        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 14+ years we’ve been making The Changelog podcast, it has never gone viral.
We’ve had popular  episodes and not so popular episodes. We’ve made episodes we love and episodes listeners love. But we’ve never had a viral moment like Elon Musk smoking weed or Jeff Bezos talking Blue Origin on our show.

We cover a wide array (get it?) of topics from improvements to built-ins such as Promises, Maps & Sets, as well as new primitives like Records, Tuples & Temporal. We round out this epic discussion with a look at cross-project standardization efforts like WinterCG, open source sustainability & how Bloomberg’s open source program gives back in important projects in the web ecosystem.

I caught up with Tammer at KubeCon NA 2023 and took the opportunity to ask him to clarify and defend the comment. This post is a fancied-up transcript of his response.
It’s better in audio where I read him some comments & we all have a good laugh. Play the audio.
NixOS has one fatal flaw, which is the usability of Nix.
(By the way, I really do love the passion in the Nix community. They created that, right? They created those comments. But Nix does have that fatal flaw of a really horrible learning curve  and user experience.)

Android’s defense-in-depth strategy applies not only to the Android OS running on the Application Processor (AP) but also the firmware that runs on devices. We particularly prioritize hardening the cellular baseband given its unique combination of running in an elevated privilege and parsing untrusted inputs that are remotely delivered into the device.


This post covers how to use two high-value sanitizers which can prevent specific classes of vulnerabilities found within the baseband. They are architecture agnostic, suitable for bare-metal deployment, and should be enabled in existing C/C++ code bases to mitigate unknown vulnerabilities. Beyond security, addressing the issues uncovered by these sanitizers improves code health and overall s…]]></summary>

Comments can be invaluable for understanding and maintaining a code base.  But excessive comments in code can become unhelpful clutter full of extraneous and/or outdated detail. 
Comments that offer useless (or worse, obsolete) information hurt readability. Here are some tips to let your code speak for itself:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on The Changelog we’re joined by Drew DeVault, talking about the Hare programming language. From the website, Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. When we asked Drew why he credted it, he said “[because] I wanted it to exist, and it did not exist.” Wise words.
Hare aims to be a 100 year language (which we get into on the show), why he’s so possionate about all things open source, the state of the language, fostering a culture that values stability, and oddly enough — what it takes to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.

Have you ever seen huge exception-handling blocks? Here is an example. Let's assume we are calling bakePizza() to bake a pizza, and it can be overbaked, throwing a PizzaOverbakedException.




class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};


void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};


try {
  // 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
  ...
  bakePizza();
  // Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.
  ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new IllegalStateException(); // Root cause ignored while throwing new exception.
}



Here are the problems with the above code:

Obscuring the logic. The method bakePizza(), is obscured by the additional lines of code of preparation and delivery, so unintended exceptions from preparation and delivery may be caught.
Catching the general exception. catch (Exception e) will catch everything, despite that we might only want to handle PizzaOverbakedException here.
Rethrowing a general exception, with the original exception ignored. This means that the root cause is lost - we don't know what exactly goes wrong with pizza baking while debugging.

Here is a better alternative, rewritten to avoid the problems above.



class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};

void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};

// 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
...
try {
  bakePizza();
} catch (PizzaOverbakedException e) {  // Other exceptions won’t be caught.
  // Rethrow a more meaningful exception; so that we know pizza is overbaked.
  throw new IllegalStateException(“You burned the pizza!”, e);  
}
// Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.
...]]></summary>
