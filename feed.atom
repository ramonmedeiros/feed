        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Schepanovski:
I always thought of 1+N as a thing that you just keep in your head, catch on code reviews or via performance regressions. This worked well for a long time, however, the less control we have over our SQL queries the more likely it will sneak through those guards…
I tumbled on a couple of 1+Ns while reading a project code for an unrelated reason and it got me thinking – do I ever want Django to do that lazy loading stuff? And the answer was never.
Turns out the implementation of this is quite easy. ~15 loc for the naive version and ~35 for a more robust version. Give it a try if you, like Alex, never want to allow a 1+N in your Django app again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This open letter by the Future of Life institute has been signed by 1380 people (so far) including notable technologists such as Steve Wozniak, Stuart Russell, Emad Mostaque (Stability AI) & Elon Musk.
Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that “At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.” We agree. That point is now.
Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ALOHA stands for “A Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation”, which is certainly a stretch in terms of acronym, but the project itself is so cool that I don’t think it really matters… Here’s the pitch:
Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface.

We were searching for something like FastAPI for Kafka-based service we were developing, but couldn’t find anything similar. So we shamelessly made one by reusing beloved paradigms from FastAPI and we shamelessly named it FastKafka.
The point was to set the expectations right - you get pretty much what you would expect: function decorators for consumers and producers with type hints specifying Pydantic classes for JSON encoding/decoding, automatic message routing to Kafka brokers and documentation generation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Steve Yegge is very excited about LLMs and thinks the rest of us should be as well:
There is something legendary and historic happening in software engineering, right now as we speak, and yet most of you don’t realize at all how big it is.
LLMs aren’t just the biggest change since social, mobile, or cloud–they’re the biggest thing since the World Wide Web. And on the coding front, they’re the biggest thing since IDEs and Stack Overflow, and may well eclipse them both.
Steve’s been in the industry a long time. He worked at Amazon back when AWS was just a demo on some engineer’s laptop and he worked at Google when Kubernetes was just a demo on some engineer’s laptop.
The point: when Steve Yegge gets excited about something it probably means more than when most people get excited about something.

Whisper is a speech recognition model enabling audio transcription and translation. Something we’re paying close attention to here at Changelog, for obvious reasons. Between the invite and the show’s recording, he had a new hit project on his hands: llama.cpp. This is a port of Facebook’s LLaMA model in C and C++. Whisper.cpp made a splash, but llama.cpp is growing in GitHub stars faster than Stable Diffusion did, which was a rocket ship itself.

Over the past few months, I’ve spoken with lots of early-career devs who are getting more and more anxious about AI. They’ve seen the increasingly-impressive demos from tools like GPT-4, and they worry that by the time they’re fluent in HTML/CSS/JS, there won’t be any jobs left for them.
I couldn’t disagree more. I don’t think web developer jobs are going anywhere. And I’m getting pretty sick of the FUD? being spread online.
So, in this blog post, I’m going to share my hypothesis for what will happen. Things are going to change, but not in the scary way people are saying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, Alpine Linux is one of the most popular options for container base images. Many people (maybe including you) use it for anything and everything. Some people use it because of its small size, some because of habit and some, just because they copy-pasted a Dockerfile from some tutorial. Yet, there are plenty of reasons why you should not use Alpine for your container images, some of which can cause you great amount of grief…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Docker CMO, Tim Anglade:
For those of you catching up, we recently emailed accounts that are members of Free Team organizations, to let them know that they will lose features unless they move to one of our supported free or paid offerings. This impacted less than 2% of our users…
The Docker Free Team subscription was deprecated in part because it was poorly targeted. In particular, it didn’t serve the open source audience as well as our recently updated Docker-Sponsored Open Source program, the latter offering benefits that exceed those of the deprecated Free Team plan.
We’d also like to clarify that public images will only be removed from Docker Hub if their maintainer decides to delete them. We’re sorry that our initial communications failed to make this clear.
Just to be clear: their apology is not about the change, it’s about how they communicated the change. There’s more details in the post about deleting public images, squatting names, etc, but that’s the gist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Ellis:
Yesterday, Docker sent an email to any Docker Hub user who had created an “organisation”, telling them their account will be deleted including all images, if they do not upgrade to a paid team plan. The email contained a link to a tersely written PDF (since, silently edited) which was missing many important details which caused significant anxiety and additional work for open source maintainers.
He goes on to explain the problem in great details. Btw, Alex is no Docker hater. He has a long history of using and supporting the tech. He goes on to say:
Open Source has a funding problem, and Docker was born in Open Source. We the community were their king makers, and now that they’re turning over significant revenue, they are only too ready to forget their roots.
This decision seems myopic. There are other image hosting options, one of them even shares (inspired?) half of DockerHub’s name… Oh, and here’s our open invitation to the folks at Docker to come on the pod.

Referring to a moment when lots of folks online were looking for the perfect writing environment, he said the software tool, workflow, environment, whatever, it didn’t matter. You could do it with pen and paper if you want.

It is an interesting time for everyone concerned with open source vulnerabilities. The U.S. Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity requirements for vulnerability disclosure programs and assurances for software used by the US government will go into effect later this year. Finding and fixing security vulnerabilities has never been more important, yet with increasing interest in the area, the vulnerability management space has become fragmented—there are a lot of new tools and competing standards. 
In 2021, we announced the launch of OSV, a database of open source vulnerabilities built partially from vulnerabilities found through Google’s OSS-Fuzz program. OSV has grown since then and now includes a…]]></summary>

Starting in Chrome 111 we will begin to turn down the Chrome Cleanup Tool, an application distributed to Chrome users on Windows to help find and remove unwanted software (UwS). 
Origin story
  
The Chrome Cleanup Tool was introduced in 2015 to help users recover from unexpected settings changes, and to detect and remove unwanted software. To date, it has performed more than 80 million cleanups, helping to pave the way for a cleaner, safer web. 
A changing landscape
  
In recent years, several factors have led us to reevaluate the need for this application to keep Chrome users on Windows safe.  
First, the user perspective – Chrome user complaints about UwS have continued to fall over the years, averaging out to around 3% of total complaints in…]]></summary>

This cycle can be long and tedious, especially as AI models and datasets are integrated. Modal is trying to make this loop of development as seamless as possible for AI practitioners, and their platform is pretty incredible!
Erik from Modal joins us in this episode to help us understand how we can run or deploy machine learning models, massively parallel compute jobs, task queues, web apps, and much more, without our own infrastructure.

We create this report every year to help talent professionals and software engineers understand the hiring climate, as well as what’s top of mind for employers and engineers.
Here’s some of their key findings:
Attracted to the field by new challenges and continuous learning, software engineers remain optimistic about the future.
Layoffs (from May to December 2022) had the greatest impact on salaries and interview interest for junior and non-traditional engineers.
Despite high-profile calls for return-to-office (RTO), demand for remote engineering talent remains high. Remote roles command higher salaries than local roles, especially in smaller markets.
The most in-demand coding skills and software engineering roles shifted this year.
There’s a lot to digest here. Worth a read, especially if you’re on the market.

Countless volumes have been written about the various benefits of serverless, a task made even easier by it being such a squishy, nebulous term that’s come to mean basically whatever the author wants it to mean. This has been a boon for AWS’s product teams, who’ve gone from creating services that are clearly serverless such as DynamoDB, Route 53, IAM, and others to instead slapping the “serverless” moniker on things that are clearly not very serverless at all, like OpenSearch and Aurora.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MRSK deploys web apps anywhere from bare metal to cloud VMs using Docker with zero downtime. It uses the dynamic reverse-proxy Traefik to hold requests while the new application container is started and the old one is stopped. It works seamlessly across multiple hosts, using SSHKit to execute commands. It was built for Rails applications, but works with any type of web app that can be containerized with Docker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andy Warner, Google Trust Services, and Carl Krauss, Product Manager, Google Domains



We’re excited to announce changes that make getting Google Trust Services TLS certificates easier for Google Domains customers. With this integration, all Google Domains customers will be able to acquire public certificates for their websites at no additional cost, whether the site runs on a Google service or uses another provider. Additionally, Google Domains is now making an API available to allow for DNS-01 challenges with Google Domains DNS servers to issue and renew certificates automatically.





Like the existing Google Cloud integration, Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol is used to enable seamless automatic lifecycle management of TLS certificates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fabien Sanglard’s advice to writers:
By starting with a markup based generator, you rob yourselves of the opportunity to learn the core technology running the whole internet. Instead you will learn to use a layer built on top of it with little to no re-usable knowledge. Inevitably, you will want to do something the framework did not forecast and will come up with convoluted ways to do it anyway.
Additionally, depending on how long you will write and how often you do it, setting up a generator may be counterproductive.
The best way to avoid the YAGNI trap is to start as simple as possible and only add tech when you’re absolutely sure the ROI is higher than the TCO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is our 9th Kaizen with Adam & Jerod. We start today’s conversation with the most important thing: embracing change. For Gerhard, this means putting Ship It on hold after this episode. It also means making more time to experiment, maybe try a few of those small bets that we recently talked about with Daniel. Kaizen will continue, we are thinking on the Changelog. Stick around to hear the rest.
