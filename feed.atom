“Secure your dependencies”—it’s the new supply chain mantra. With attacks targeting software supply chains sharply rising, open source developers need to monitor and judge the risks of the projects they rely on. Our previous installment of the Supply chain security for Go series shared the ecosystem tools available to Go developers to manage their dependencies and vulnerabilities. This second installment describes the ways that Go helps you trust the integrity of a Go package. 










Go has built-in protections against three major ways packages can be compromised before reaching you: 

A new, malicious version of your dependency is published

A package is withdrawn from the ecosystem

2022 was a successful year for Google's Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs), with over 2,900 security issues identified and fixed, and over $12 million in bounty rewards awarded to researchers.

We first announced the Google Cloud VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of Google Cloud and to incentivize sharing knowledge on Cloud vulnerability research with the world.

🎧  Click here to listen along while you read. It's better!   🎧
The advantages of WebAssembly, with its:
tight security model
very fast boot-up time
scalability at the edge
much smaller footprints
portability across environments
will really drive a shift away from container-based runtimes for things Kubernetes and edge workloads by 2030. There’s a ton of energy around making this happen within the WebAssembly community.

2. Extension Risk Assessment

Every day, personal data, such as location information, images, or text queries are passed between your device and remote, cloud-based services. Your data is encrypted when in transit and at rest, but as potential attack vectors grow more sophisticated, data must also be protected during use by the service, especially for software systems that handle personally identifiable user data.





Toward this goal, Google’s Project Oak is a research effort that relies on the confidential computing paradigm to build an infrastructure for processing sensitive user data in a secure and privacy-preserving way: we ensure data is protected during transit, at rest, and while in use.

In 2020, we integrated kCTF into Google's Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) to support researchers evaluating the security of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and the underlying Linux kernel.

We extended the VRP's scope and maximum reward in 2021 (to $50k), then again in February 2022 (to $91k), and finally in August 2022 (to $133k). In 2022, we also summarized our learnings to date in our cookbook, and introduced our experimental mitigations for the most common exploitation techniques.

As an admin, they can use the Google Admin console to get Chrome to report critical security events to third-party service providers such as Splunk® to create custom enterprise security remediation workflows.


Security remediation is the process of responding to security events that have been triggered by a system or a user. Remediation can be done manually or automatically, and it is an important part of an enterprise security program.
