Windows is a critical element in this system because it is hard to find good productivity software that runs on Windows, especially if you want to run it outside of a web browser. Windows, in my opinion, is far behind Mac OS X, iOS, and Android, in having thoughtfully designed and efficient software—both in general, and in particular for writing, organization, and task management

The 4.6 release of Docker Desktop for Mac contains a number of changes that drastically improve file sharing performance for macOS users. Firstly, developers now have the option of using a new experimental file sharing implementation called virtiofs (the current default is gRPC-FUSE). Secondly, improvements have been made to the way that files are synced between the macOS host and Docker VM. During testing with our amazing macOS community of users, we have observed that these changes have reduced the time taken to complete filesystem operations by up to 98%.
virtiofs is an experimental feature, so you need to enable it to realize these gains.

My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.
C is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.
And just in case these pull quotes leave you with the impression that Aria is happy about the situation… yeah, nope.

In their moment, minicomputers were used in a variety of applications. They served as communications controllers, instrument controllers, large system pre-processors, desk calculators, and real-time data acquisition handlers. But they also laid the foundation for significant hardware architecture advances and contributed greatly to modern operating systems, programming languages, and interactive computing as we know them today.

Git repositories and their contents are represented as regular directories and files and are accessible by any application, without the application having any knowledge that it is really accessing a remote Git repository. The repositories are writable and allow editing files and running build operations.
So if you hubfs mnt (on macOS/Linux), it will set up a file hierarchy inside /mnt that follows this pattern: / owner / repository / ref / path. Cool idea! It is affected by GitHub’s API rate limiting and I’m not sure if/how it syncs (commits) back to the remote repos…

look in developer tools for a promising JSON response
copy as cURL
remove irrelevant headers
translate it into Python
Some of you might be wondering – can you always do this?
The answer is sort of yes – browsers aren’t magic! All the information browsers send to your backend is just HTTP requests. So if I copy all of the HTTP headers that my browser is sending, I think there’s literally no way for the backend to tell that the request isn’t sent by my browser and is actually being sent by a random Python program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This proposal is brand new (stage 0), but I hear that a lot of work has been put into it behind the scenes by a lot of people, so it has that going for it…
This proposal aims to enable developers to add type annotations to their JavaScript code, allowing those annotations to be checked by a type checker that is external to JavaScript. At runtime, a JavaScript engine ignores them, treating the types as comments.
The aim of this proposal is to enable developers to run programs written in TypeScript, Flow, and other static typing supersets of JavaScript without any need for transpilation, if they stick within a certain reasonably large subset of the language.
The implications of this change are pretty massive, if it were to ever ship. And you better believe we’re putting together a JS Party episode to discuss it with the people involved.

If you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like 'exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild' have been appearing more often recently. In this post we'll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We'll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. 
How things work today 
While the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it's because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it's actually a good thing! I…]]></summary>

Let me start by saying a few things that seem obvious,” Geoffrey Hinton, “Godfather” of deep learning, and one of the most celebrated scientists of our time, told a leading AI conference in Toronto in 2016. “If you work as a radiologist you’re like the coyote that’s already over the edge of the cliff but hasn’t looked down.” Deep learning is so well-suited to reading images from MRIs and CT scans, he reasoned, that people should “stop training radiologists now” and that it’s “just completely obvious within five years deep learning is going to do better.”
Fast forward to 2022, and not a single radiologist has been replaced.
But he doesn’t stop there. After laying out multiple examples of deep learning failures, he change tone:
For the first time in 40 years, I finally feel some optimism about AI.

Should you move to serverless? Is GraphQL the answer to your API woes? Should you follow the latest DevOps playbook to increase your system reliability? In the world of tech tools, there’s a lot of buzz. But it doesn’t always reflect the daily reality of programmers.
As the founder of a developer tools startup, I’ve talked with hundreds, if not thousands, of software developers over the last few years in the course of routine user research. The common theme in these conversations, even bigger than the need for the product we were building, was an overarching need that is currently underserved: building for real developers, or what I like to call the 99% Developers.
Good stuff to be reminded of. That reminds me: You are not Google/Amazon/LinkedIn.

When you hear the phrase “cloud native,” is Kubernetes the first thing that comes to your mind? It is for me, and I expect I’m not alone. Kubernetes is now the second-largest open source project after Linux, and it’s the big fish in the cloud native pond. But there are many other projects in the CNCF landscape and the broader cloud native community.
So, I thought I’d list some cloud native tools that can be very useful for teams that aren’t using Kubernetes or aren’t using it for every workload. Here are 7 of them that I like a lot.
If Rich’s name rings a bell, that’s because he was just on Ship It! last week. 😉

This project have started as an experiment to discover generics implementation. It may look like Lodash in some aspects. I used to code with the awesome go-funk package, but it uses reflection and therefore is not typesafe.
As expected, benchmarks demonstrate that generics will be much faster than implementations based on reflect stdlib package. Benchmarks also shows similar performances to pure for loops.

        <link href="https://github.com/sigoden/argc"/>
        <updated>2022-03-04T15:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Argc is a little Rust program that your bash scripts can use to make handling command-line parameters easy. You describe the options, parameters, and subcommands in comments like this:
# @describe A demo cli

# @cmd Upload a file
# @arg target!                      File to upload
upload() {
    echo "cmd                       upload"
    echo "arg:  target              $argc_target"
}

Then you trust Argc to parse that and do the heavy lifting:
eval "$(argc -e $0 "$@")"

The only drawback (aside from potential parsing bugs) to this approach is your script now depends on having argc in the machine’s executable path. i.e. – it’s not portable.
What’d be even cooler, IMHO, would be to instead use argc as a pre-processor of sorts that spits out a pure-bash implementation from your input script. Regardless, a cool idea!

        <updated>2022-03-03T15:07:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chris Ferdinandi:
For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!
I built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I’ve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.
Heck, even Chris’s disclaimer of ‘when SPAs make sense’ section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation. But I digress… read this post it’s a good one for sure.

DNA tells our body (and every other organism) which proteins to produce; these proteins are tiny machines that carry out enormous tasks, from fighting off infection to helping you ace an upcoming exam in school.


But for about a third of all proteins that all organisms produce, we just don’t know what they do. It’s kind of like we’re in a factory where everything’s buzzing, and we’re surrounded by all these impressive tools, but we have only a vague idea of what’s going on. Understanding how these tools operate, and how we can use them, is where we think machine learning can make a big difference.

While working on the frontlines of open source, Feross and team have witnessed firsthand how supply chain attacks have swept across the software community and have damaged the trust in open source. Socket turns the problem of securing open source software on its head, and asks…“What if we assume all open source may be malicious?” So, they built a system that proactively detects indicators of compromised open source packages and brings awareness to teams in real-time. We cover the whys, the hows, and what’s next for this ambitious and very much needed project.

For a software engineer, the hardest thing about developing Machine Learning functionality should be finding clean and representative ground-truth data, but it often isn’t. If you already have a source of good quality data (perhaps because it is already gathered by your application), here are some obstacles that still lay ahead of you
From the difficult to grasp concepts to the varied (and variable quality) software you’ll need to explore and manage the data, there’s still a lot of obstacles in our path before we can put a model to good use.

Linux kernel support for the 32-bit ARM architecture was contributed in the late 90s, when there was little corporate involvement in Linux development, and most contributors were students or hobbyists, tinkering with development boards, often without much in the way of documentation.


Now 20+ years later, 32-bit ARM's maintainer has downgraded its support level to 'odd fixes,' while remaining active as a kernel contributor. This is a common pattern for aging and obsolete architectures: corporate funding for Linux kernel development has tremendously increased the pace of development, but only for architectures with a high return on investment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knut Melvær with a thoughtful attack on one of my all-time favorite tools:
Markdown is a signifier for the developer and text-tinkerer culture. But since its introduction, the world of digital content has also changed. While Markdown is still fine for some things, I don’t believe it’s should be the go-to for content anymore.
There are two main reasons for this:
Markdown wasn’t designed to meet today’s needs of content.
Markdown holds editorial experience back.
Now, I did say it’s a thoughtful atttack and it’s also a long one (30 minute read). Knut does the work, diving deep into Markdown’s history and John Gruber’s desires for it:
I want to build my advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web. For many of us, I suspect Markdown is something we just take for granted as a “thing that exists.” But all technology has a history and is a product of human interaction. This is important to remember when you, the reader, develop technology for others to use.

Grist is a modern relational spreadsheet. It combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the robustness of a database to organize your data and make you more productive.
Since so many people make the Airtable comparison that I did in the headline, the team behind Grist has written up a comparison of the two offerings.
