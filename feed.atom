Nobody likes preventable site errors, but they happen disappointingly often. 



The last thing you want your customers to see is a dreaded 'Your connection is not private' error instead of the service they expected to reach. Most certificate errors are preventable and one of the best ways to help prevent issues is by automating your certificate lifecycle using the ACME standard. Google Trust Services now offers our ACME API to all users with a Google Cloud account (referred to as “users” here), allowing them to automatically acquire and renew publicly-trusted TLS certificates for free.

Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
That’s a hard pill to swallow, especially when your project is late. But it’s a truth pill, which makes it worth choking down. Here’s another truth pill that Brooks wrote in his paper No Silver Bullet–Essence and Accident in Software Engineering:

Google’s Open Source Security Team recently sponsored a fuzzing competition as part of ISCE’s Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT) Workshop. Our goal was to encourage the development of new fuzzing techniques, which can lead to the discovery of software vulnerabilities and ultimately a safer open source ecosystem. 



The competitors’ fuzzers were judged on code coverage and their ability to discover bugs: 

HasteFuzz took the $11,337 prize for code coverage

PASTIS and AFLrustrust tied for bug discovery and split the $11,337 prize

Today, we are announcing Buzzer, a new eBPF Fuzzing framework that aims to help hardening the Linux Kernel.
What is eBPF and how does it verify safety?

eBPF is a technology that allows developers and sysadmins to easily run programs in a privileged context, like an operating system kernel. Recently, its popularity has increased, with more products adopting it as, for example, a network filtering solution. At the same time, it has maintained its relevance in the security research community, since it provides a powerful attack surface into the operating system.





While there are many solutions for fuzzing vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, they are not necessarily tailored to the unique features of eBP…]]></summary>

Safe Browsing: faster more intelligent protection


Android uses Safe Browsing to protect billions of users from web-based threats, like deceptive phishing sites. This happens in the Chrome default browser and also in Android WebView, when you open web content from apps.

With the newest version of Safe Browsing, devices will do real-time blocklist checks for low reputation sites. Our internal analysis has found that a significant number of phishing sites only exist for less than ten minutes to try and stay ahead of block-lists. With this real-time detection, we expect we’ll be able to block an additional 25 percent…]]></summary>

Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don’t always have the community or support they need. That’s why we’re celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May. Today’s conversation features Alyssa Wright (Bloomberg), Chad Whitacre (Sentry), and Duane O’Brien (Creator of the FOSS Contributor Fund and framework). We get into all the details, the why, the hows, and the struggles involved for companies to support open source.
