Google is committed to enhancing the security of open-source technologies, especially those that make up the foundation for many of our products, like Linux and KVM. To this end we are excited to announce the launch of kvmCTF, a vulnerability reward program (VRP) for the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor first announced in October 2023.





KVM is a robust hypervisor with over 15 years of open-source development and is widely used throughout the consumer and enterprise landscape, including platforms such as Android and Google Cloud. Google is an active contributor to the project and we designed kvmCTF as a collaborative way to help identify & remediate vulnerabilities and further harden this fundamental security boundary.

The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, recently kicked off a two-year AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), inviting top AI and cybersecurity experts to design new AI systems to help secure major open source projects which our critical infrastructure relies upon. As AI continues to grow, it’s crucial to invest in AI tools for Defenders, and this competition will help advance technology to do so. 





Google’s OSS-Fuzz and Security Engineering teams have been excited to assist AIxCC organizers in designing their challenges and competition framework. We also playtested the competition by building a Cyber Reasoning System (CRS) tackling DARPA’s exemplar challenge.
