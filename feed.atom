We explore “suspicion machines” — systems that assign scores to welfare program participants, estimating their likelihood of committing fraud. Join us as Justin and Gabriel share insights from their thorough investigation, which involved gaining access to one of these models and meticulously analyzing its behavior.

Have you ever seen huge exception-handling blocks? Here is an example. Let's assume we are calling bakePizza() to bake a pizza, and it can be overbaked, throwing a PizzaOverbakedException.




class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};


void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};


try {
  // 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
  ...
  bakePizza();
  // Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.
  ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new IllegalStateException(); // Root cause ignored while throwing new exception.
}



Here are the problems with the above code:

Obscuring the logic. The method bakePizza(), is obscured by the additional lines of code of preparation and delivery, so unintended exceptions from preparation and delivery may be caught.
Catching the general exception. catch (Exception e) will catch everything, despite that we might only want to handle PizzaOverbakedException here.
Rethrowing a general exception, with the original exception ignored. This means that the root cause is lost - we don't know what exactly goes wrong with pizza baking while debugging.

Here is a better alternative, rewritten to avoid the problems above.



class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};

void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};

// 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
...
try {
  bakePizza();
} catch (PizzaOverbakedException e) {  // Other exceptions won’t be caught.
  // Rethrow a more meaningful exception; so that we know pizza is overbaked.
  throw new IllegalStateException(“You burned the pizza!”, e);  
}
// Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.

Systems such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Play rely on text classification models to identify harmful content including phishing attacks, inappropriate comments, and scams. These types of texts are harder for machine learning models to classify because bad actors rely on adversarial text manipulations to actively attempt to evade the classifiers. For example, they will use homoglyphs, invisible characters, and keyword stuffing to bypass defenses.

The book Clean Code discusses a camping rule that is good to keep in the back of your mind when writing code:



Leave the campground cleaner than you found it



So how does that fit into software development? The thinking is this: When you make changes to code that can potentially be improved, try to make it just a little bit better.
This doesn't necessarily mean you have to go out of your way to do huge refactorings. Changing something small can go a long way:

The question they’re trying to answer is “How do you create a home for developers in a design tool?” We go way back to Emil’s startup that was acquired by Figma called Visly, how we iterated to here from 20 years ago (think PSD > HTML days), what they did to build Dev Mode, what they’re doing around codegen, the popularity of design systems, and what it takes to go from zero to Dev Mode.

We'll also shed light on how adoption of MVSP has helped Google improve its security processes, and hope this example will help motivate third-parties to increase their adoption of MVSP controls and thus improve product security across the industry.
