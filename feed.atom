Improving the interoperability of web services is an important and worthy goal. We believe that it should be easier for people to maintain and control their digital identities. And we appreciate that policymakers working on European Union digital certificate legislation, known as eIDAS, are working toward this goal. However, a specific part of the legislation, Article 45, hinders browsers’ ability to enforce certain security requirements on certificates, potentially holding back advances in web security for decades. We and many past and present leaders in the international web community have significant concerns about Article 45's impact on security. 


We urge lawmakers to heed the calls of scientists and security experts to revise this part of the legislation rather than erode users’ privacy and security on the web.]]></summary>

Keeping Google Play safe for users and developers remains a top priority for Google. As users increasingly prioritize their digital privacy and security, we continue to invest in our Data Safety section and transparency labeling efforts to help users make more informed choices about the apps they use. 


Research shows that transparent security labeling plays a crucial role in consumer risk perception, building trust, and influencing product purchasing decisions. We believe the same principles apply for labeling and badging in the Google Play store. The transparency of an app’s data security and privacy play a key role in a user’s decision to download, trust, and use an app.

That realization led her to found Akita Software, which led her to join Postman by way of acquisition. That move, at least in part, also led her to join us on this very podcast. We think you’re going to enjoy this interview, we sure did.

What problem in the code below makes the test hard to follow?




def test_get_balance(self):
  settings = BankSettings(FDIC_INSURED, REGULATED, US_BASED)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems like everyone is interested in Rust these days. Even the most popular Python linter, Ruff, isn’t written in Python! It’s written in Rust. But what is the state of training or inferencing deep learning models in Rust? In this episode, we are joined by Nathaniel Simard, the creator burn. We discuss Rust in general, the need to have support for AI in multiple languages, and the current state of doing “AI things” in Rust.

When adding loops and conditionals, even simple code can become difficult to understand.
Consider this change:




if (commode.HasPreferredCustomer()) {

if (commode.HasPreferredCustomer()) {


  commode.WarmSeat();

  commode.WarmSeat();



} else if (commode.CustomerOnPhone()) {



  commode.ChillSeat();


}

}




While the above change may seem simple, even adding a single else statement can make the code harder to follow since the complexity of code grow…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Listen to our Next Level album as a podcast! We grew up in the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. It’s no surprise that so many of our tracks are inspired by the 8-bit and 16-bit music of our youth. From Castlevania to Contra, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more — we were inspired by all the nostalgic soundtracks from the games that got us here, to give our pods one-of-a-kind vibes. If you’ve been head nodding to our beats during our shows and you’ve been wishing for a way to listen outside of our pods, then this release will be an absolute delight.
It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this on your next coding adventure or deep work session…

Theme songs, outros, ad music, ins, outs, stabs, robot noises, jingles… you name it and BMC has produced it for us. All with that signature glitchy goodness that BMC is known for. Eventually, we ended up with a deep catalog of tracks that only live on our podcasts or on our hard drives. Not anymore, baby!

Shell scripts (including Bash scripts) can be convenient for automating simple command line procedures, and they are often better than keeping complicated commands in a single developer's history. However, shell scripts can be hard to understand and maintain, and are typically not as well-supported as other programming languages. Shell scripts have less support for unit testing, and there is likely a lower chance that somebody reading one will be experienced with the language.

In July 2023, four Googlers from the Enterprise Security and Access Security organizations developed a tool that aimed at revolutionizing the way Googlers interact with Access Control Lists - SpeakACL. This tool, awarded the Gold Prize during Google’s internal Security & AI Hackathon, allows developers to create or modify security policies using simple English instructions rather than having to learn system-specific syntax or complex security principles. This can save security and product teams hours of time and effort, while helping to protect the information of their users by encouraging the reduction of permitted access by adhering to the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Andrew Walbran, Android Rust Team


moving native code in Android from C++ to Rust has resulted in fewer security vulnerabilities. Most of the components we mentioned then were system services in userspace (running under Linux), but these are not the only components typically written in memory-unsafe languages. Many security-critical components of an Android system run in a “bare-metal” environment, outside of the Linux kernel, and these are historically written in C. As part of our efforts to harden firmware on Android devices, we are increasingly using Rust in these bare-metal environments too.


To that end, we have rewritten the Android Virtualization Framework’s protected VM (pVM) firmware in Rust to provide a memory safe foundation for the pVM root of trust. This firmware p…]]></summary>
