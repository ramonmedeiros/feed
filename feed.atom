We talk about Docker Swarm beginnings, some of the challenges that it faced, and what Andrea’s recommendation is for Tyler’s journey with Docker Swarm.
After dedicating four years of his professional career to Docker Swarm, Andrea is the best person that Gerhard knows to talk about this subject. And guess what, the same thing happened now as it did at KubeCon 2015: Sam pointed to Andrea. It will all make sense in the first five minutes. This one is going to be fun!

Why? Because, Final Fantasy 7 is a true classic. When the game was first released in early 1997, for the Sony PlayStation, it took the RPG gaming world by storm. To this day, many consider it the greatest entry in the franchise.
I remember getting this game for Christmas and playing it nearly non-stop until school started again after the new year. Greatest entry in the franchise? Easily!

My foremost exposure to the practice came from Jeremy Ashkenas’ CoffeeScript and Backbone.js docs. I always found it cool and useful to read, but couldn’t imagine myself writing code/docs that way. Which brings us to this bit at the end of the article:
“One of the things we learned is that it’s very expensive,” he said. “And so you spend time trying to figure out what sort of situations justify the expense. And one of them is where people are building relatively small, sophisticated kernels that are going to be shared widely.”
Seems like Jeremy’s use case drilled it. If you’re mostly writing application code, literate programming probably isn’t worth the headache, but for library/framework authors…

Many of the recent high-profile software attacks that have alarmed open-source users globally were consequences of supply chain integrity vulnerabilities: attackers gained control of a build server to use malicious source files, inject malicious artifacts into a compromised build platform, and bypass trusted builders to upload malicious artifacts. 
Each of these attacks could have been prevented if there were a way to detect that the delivered artifacts diverged from the expected origin of the software. But until now, generating verifiable information that described where, when, and how software artifacts were produced (information known as provenance) was difficult.

The next Google can’t just be an input box that spits out links. We need new thinking to create something much better than what came before.
In the last few years, different groups of people came to the same conclusion, and started working on the next generation of search engines.
For this new generation, privacy is necessary, and invasive ads are not an option. But that’s where the commonalities end. Beyond that, they’ve all taken the idea of a search engine in very different directions.
The post goes on to describe & detail a whole new wave of search engines. I had no idea so many people were working on this problem. Exciting!

Our goal is not just to make Linux run on these machines but to polish it to the point where it can be used as a daily OS. Doing this requires a tremendous amount of work, as Apple Silicon is an entirely undocumented platform. In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open-source driver for it.
Asahi Linux is developed by a thriving community of free and open source software developers.
Yes, please!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Squeaky team goes from dev straight to prod (same here), but many people advocate for (and use) staging or other “pre-live” environments instead.
While there are obvious benefits to deploying to different environments, at Squeaky we’ve decided to take a different approach. We only have two environments: our laptops, and production. Once we merge into the main branch, it will be immediately deployed to production.
Perhaps that sounds unusual, but so far it’s outweighed the benefits of pre-live environments, and we believe it’s helping us to ship faster, and lower the number of issues on production. So, I thought I’d write this post to share why we think it works, and why you should consider it too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the press from our friend Ben Johnson:
Postlite is a network proxy to allow access to remote SQLite databases over the Postgres wire protocol. This allows GUI tools to be used on remote SQLite databases which can make administration easier.
The proxy works by translating Postgres frontend wire messages into SQLite transactions and converting results back into Postgres response wire messages. Many Postgres clients also inspect the pg_catalog to determine system information so Postlite mirrors this catalog by using an attached in-memory database with virtual tables. The proxy also performs minor rewriting on these system queries to convert them to usable SQLite syntax.
It appears that Ben is taking code contributions this time around, but only for bug & documentation fixes.

After seeing the project about how to Rickroll your friends with Grafana — in which a seemingly innocent hyperlink surprises users with the music video for Astley’s classic “Never Gonna Give You Up” rendered with Prometheus and Grafana — a question arose: Can Grafana run Doom?
Thankfully, this post breaks Betteridge’s law of headlines. The answer to the question is a resounding yes!

Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out” time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
In addition to the author’s suggested solution to this problem allow me to add: developer retention! Nobody has more to figure out in a system than the people who just joined the team. Cut down on that (via better compensation, workplace satisfaction, etc.) and you cut way down on that oh so expensive “figuring out” time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-grained authorization in microservices is hard. Definitely not impossible, but hard. You would expect that a more standardized, all-around, full-proof solution is out there, but I am afraid there isn’t. It’s a complex matter and depending on what you are building, implementation varies.
You will probably start with a boolean admin flag in your User model and then you will replace it with a role field, as we all did. However, as things progress and the business model becomes more and more complex, so do the solutions that we need to implement in order to deal with that complexity.
But how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment? In the following post I hope to help you get there.

Yes, he was there at Bell Labs when it all began. And he is still at it today, writing books and teaching the next generation at Princeton.
This is an epic and wide ranging conversation. You’ll hear about the birth of Unix, Ken Thompson’s unique skillset, why Brian thinks C has stood the test of time, his thoughts on modern languages like Go and Rust, what’s changed in 50 years of software, what makes platforms like Unix and the web so powerful, his take as a professor on the trend of programmers skipping the university track, and so much more.
Seriously, this is a must-listen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Wikman reacts to Gerhard’s excellent conversation with Kelsey Hightower on Ship It!
So he essentially said, I’m interpreting here, that when it comes to deploying software to servers the documented manual steps for deploying something need to be the canonical reference. Then whether you build bash scripts, Ansible playbooks, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, Terraform, Kubernetes or something else to encode that procedure into something repeatable and scalable that’s a separate step. Having documented the process required to set it up means that there is an answer to the question: How do I get this running? An answer that doesn’t require you to parse the .yml files or grok Ansible roles and groups.
Lars springs forward from there with many thoughts of his own on the matter.

Here I would like to share exactly how I help prevent bugs on projects and how I help others come up with ideas on how to prevent bugs as well.

I think this strategy of intentional avoidance and/or deprioritization is perfect for disasters.
The challenge with systems that do not fail is that they have no fixes when they eventually fail. Thus, it is more urgent to fix these systems than is usually accepted.

Auditing is particularly useful for historical analysis. To demonstrate, imagine you have a users table that tracks when a user is online. You might add a status column which can have one of two values: online and offline. How would you track how long a user is online for throughout an entire month? An auditing system would track every change with timestamps, and so you can measure the difference between each timestamp and sum them up for the entire month.
What really impresses me about the Supabase team is how much they’re leaning in to Postgres’ rich feature set to build high-quality-yet-low-level abstractions for their users. Paul Copplestone emphasized this when we had him on the show back in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Max Howell, creator of Homebrew, has gone back to his notes on brew2 to apply web3 concepts to help “distribute value to open source.” He’s calling this new brew tea.
Tools like Homebrew lie beneath all development tools, assisting developers to actually get development done. We know the graph of all open source, which means we’re uniquely placed to innovate in interesting and exciting ways. This is exactly what tea will do. We’re taking our knowledge of how to make development more efficient and throwing innovations nobody has ever really considered before.
With plans to move the package registry on-chain, Max lays out the numerous benefits due to “inherent benefits of blockchain technology”:
Packages will be immutable (no more left-pad incidents)
Packages will always be available (we’ll use decentralized storage)
Releases will be signed by the maintainers themselves (rather than a middleman you are told you can trust)
Tools can be built to fundamentally verify the integrity of your app’s open source constitution
Token can flow through the graph
Max says “token flowing is where things get really interesting,” and goes on to say “with our system people who care about the health of the open source ecosystem buy some token and stake it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Jon Maddox on The GitHub blog (from waaay back in the day):
At GitHub, we have normalized on a set of script names for all of our projects that individual contributors will be familiar with the second after they clone a project. We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.
Here’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:
script/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies
script/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time
script/update – updates a project to run at its current version
script/server – starts app
script/test – runs tests
script/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests
script/console – opens a console
Each of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.
Note: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.

But just like that time you whacked a zombie over the head with a shovel only to discover it was really your friend Jimmy with a hangover, this would be a grave mistake. And I use the term ‘grave’ advisedly, because having sent Jimmy to an early grave, this would increase the likelihood of him becoming a zombie in the not too distant future.

One key decision, made for speed above all else, is to capture as much of my thinking and work in plaintext as I can. Thus the name: Plaintext Productivity
This article speaks my language, but does so to a corner of the software world that I don’t visit too often: Windows
Windows is a critical element in this system because it is hard to find good productivity software that runs on Windows, especially if you want to run it outside of a web browser. Windows, in my opinion, is far behind Mac OS X, iOS, and Android, in having thoughtfully designed and efficient software—both in general, and in particular for writing, organization, and task management

On any moderately-sized Node.js project you’ve likely already outgrown the package.json “scripts” section. But because the growth was gradual, with no single acute pain point, you might not have noticed. There’s a better way.
I’ve never been able to get into Makefiles, but many people I respect love them. For me the syntax is too arcane, but I recognize the power. If the “scripts” section of your package.json is getting unwieldy, it might be time for a make over. (yes I went there)

One way the team does this is by conducting proactive algorithmic product fairness — or ProFair — testing. This means bringing social and cultural perspectives to the testing process, to assess how an AI or ML application, dataset or technique might avoid reinforcing unfair bias. Three women who work on ProFair testing are Anne Peckham, N’Mah Y. and Cherish M. and today we’re asking them: What’s your job?

The 4.6 release of Docker Desktop for Mac contains a number of changes that drastically improve file sharing performance for macOS users. Firstly, developers now have the option of using a new experimental file sharing implementation called virtiofs (the current default is gRPC-FUSE). Secondly, improvements have been made to the way that files are synced between the macOS host and Docker VM. During testing with our amazing macOS community of users, we have observed that these changes have reduced the time taken to complete filesystem operations by up to 98%.
virtiofs is an experimental feature, so you need to enable it to realize these gains.

My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.
C is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.
And just in case these pull quotes leave you with the impression that Aria is happy about the situation… yeah, nope.

Supporting this important work is a priority for Google.org.

In their moment, minicomputers were used in a variety of applications. They served as communications controllers, instrument controllers, large system pre-processors, desk calculators, and real-time data acquisition handlers. But they also laid the foundation for significant hardware architecture advances and contributed greatly to modern operating systems, programming languages, and interactive computing as we know them today.
We were just discussing this machine on our upcoming episode with Brian Kernighan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HUBFS is a file system for GitHub and Git. Git repositories and their contents are represented as regular directories and files and are accessible by any application, without the application having any knowledge that it is really accessing a remote Git repository. The repositories are writable and allow editing files and running build operations.
So if you hubfs mnt (on macOS/Linux), it will set up a file hierarchy inside /mnt that follows this pattern: / owner / repository / ref / path. Cool idea! It is affected by GitHub’s API rate limiting and I’m not sure if/how it syncs (commits) back to the remote repos…

Use conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Don’t use too many, and use the same status codes for the same outcomes across the API.
