See how quickly I abandoned ship there? Ok, it’s not that hard to explain. I just didn’t feel like taking the time to explain it when it wasn’t even my point. Good thing Double Agent Caleb Hearth did a nice write-up on Test Double’s blog about it!

The M&A prospect may have a partially unprotected attack surface, thus increasing security risk coming in the form of a gap between the attack surface they can and do protect and the attack surface (and accompanying assets) they need to defend. This gap is what many M&A prospects bring to the table. And while an M&A may have undisputed business and strategic value, CISOs must still address the security risks involved in acquiring another organization's assets and its current attack surface, fully protected or not.]]></summary>

A modular monolith is the exact opposite of a distributed ball of mud: a well-structured, well-architected, highly modular program that runs as a single process and is as boring as possible.
Sid doesn’t pull any punches. No regrets!
Wouldn’t it be better to have a proper plugin interface? Or better yet, a services interface modeled on microservices? In a word: no. Not only do these approaches impose deployment and integration hurdles that go far beyond “I made a small change to the source code,” they often enforce architectural constraints too rigidly. Anticipating all the future extension points is a fool’s errand, one that we luckily did not embark on and do not have to.

No JS is shipped to the client by default
No build step
No configuration required
TypeScript support out of the box
If you’re feeling some JavaScript and/or Framework Fatigue, this won’t help. But competition pushes everyone (Next, Remix, etc) to improve. So, whether you check Fresh out or not, hopefully it’ll have a positive impact on your work.

We asked SQLite creator Richard Hipp about his database’s gap in penetration back when we first told the story of SQLite’s success in 2016:
Now for a website where you’ve got a lot of write concurrency, you need to move to a client-server database engine because you need that server process there to coordinate the concurrency… There’s just no way to do that in a serverless database like SQLite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nolan Lawson:
Anyone who’s worked in the tech industry for long enough, especially at larger organizations, has seen it before. A legacy system exists: it’s big, it’s complex, and no one fully understands how it works. Architects are brought in to “fix” the system. They might wheel out a big whiteboard showing a lot of boxes and arrows pointing at other boxes, and inevitably, their solution is… to add more boxes and arrows. Nobody can subtract from the system; everyone just adds.
Nolan posits the center cannot hold and the current market shift from bull to bear might help bring the collapse of complex software. But it’s never that simple, is it?
One thing working in complexity’s favor, though, is that engineers like complexity. Admit it: as much as we complain about other people’s complexity, we love our own. We love sitting around and dreaming up new architectural diagrams that can comfortably sit inside our own heads – it’s only when these diagrams leave our heads, take shape in the real world, and outgrow the size of any one person’s head that the problems begin.

Generative art is a creative process. While recent advances of DALL·E unleash people’s creativity, having a single-prompt-single-output UX/UI locks the imagination to a single possibility, which is bad no matter how fine this single result is. DALL·E Flow is an alternative to the one-liner, by formalizing the generative art as an iterative procedure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Google we use technologies like machine learning (ML) to build more useful products — from filtering out email spam, to keeping maps up to date, to offering more relevant search results. Chrome is no exception: We use ML to make web images more accessible to people who are blind or have low vision, and we also generate real-time captions for online videos, in service of people in noisy environments, and those who are hard of hearing.
This work in Chrome continues, so we wanted to share some recent and future ML improvements that offer a safer, more accessible and more personalized browsing experience. Importantly: these updates are powered by on-device ML models, which means your data stays private, and never leaves your device.

Atom has not had significant feature development for the past several years, though we’ve conducted maintenance and security updates during this period to ensure we’re being good stewards of the project and product. As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we’ve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.
Atom was co-founder and long-time CEO Chris Wanstrath’s baby. We first heard its story from project lead Nathan Sobo on The Changelog back in 2017. Here’s what he had to say about the end of Atom’s era:
As Atom’s sun sets, Zed’s sun is rising. We’re not done here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Wikman on the history of ID3 tags:
If you were a Winamp user back in the day, or curate an MP3 collection currently, you might recognize the humble ID3 tag. It is what the metadata in the MP3 file is made up of. First it was pretty limited in the version later dubbed ID3v1. Like any good 2.0 they added a ton more fields, features, removed character limits and it was suddenly ID3v2. The latest spec is ID3v2.4 while the most commonly adopted one seems to be ID3v2.3. I recently found myself having a reason to dig into this specification.
I wonder what reason he might have to dig into this spec? Could it be for a soon-to-be-announced collab with his friends at Changelog? 😏
This post is not about the technical intricacies of the format… This is about a simpler time, where people saw the wild possibilities of music on computers and when people cared about files, damnit. This is about some of the most interesting and entertaining things I’ve run across while reading the spec.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the smaller (but big for webdevs) announcements from yesterday’s WWDC keynote was Web Push coming to Safari. It’s built on three web standards all working together. What does it do, well it enables websites to “notify their users of time-sensitive or high-priority events, even if the user does not currently have the site open.”
As long as you’ve coded your web application to the standards you will be able to reach Safari 16 users on macOS Ventura. You don’t need to join the Apple Developer Program to send Web Push notifications.
That’s good news, but is this feature something users want? I can think of zero websites that I’ve allowed to send me notifications even when Safari is open, let alone when I’m not even browsing the web.
Jen Simmons posted a nice thread on Twitter alongside the announcement and fielded many people’s questions/concerns along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christopher Meiklejohn has been working for two years on developing an automated resilience testing tool called Filibuster and was able to test it out at DoorDash during his research internship:
Access to DoorDash’s real-world industrial microservice application was extremely valuable both to ensure that Filibuster’s design matches how microservice applications are developed today and to influence future features that I would not have identified in a lab setting.
The results were pretty good! Maybe we won’t need chaos monkeys as tools like Filibuster advance?
In short, Filibuster can identify many of the technical resilience issues that exist in applications earlier, at the time of development, without testing in production as required in more traditional chaos engineering techniques.

        <updated>2022-06-06T14:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Victor Engmark thinks we should start test names with “should” for a handful of reasons, here’s a few:
It removes redundancy, because the function name should already be in the call stack.
It is falsifiable, a person reviewing the test can decide to which degree the name agrees with the actual test.
It encourages testing one property of the function per test
I don’t disagree, but I like to take it a step further: Let the “should” be implied by the rest of the test name.
Instead of: should replace children when updating instance
I prefer: replaces children when updating instances
Instead of: should apply discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
I prefer: applies discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
Most of Victor’s reasons for using “should” still apply with this format, but it’s less verbose and more accurately describes the software working as expected when the tests pass.

2021 was another record-breaking year for our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). We paid a total of $8.7 million in rewards, our highest amount yet. 2021 saw some amazing work from the security research community. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the reports we received were for findings in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. It is heartening to see an increasing number of talented researchers getting involved in cloud security.
We first announced the GCP VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of GCP, in turn helping us make GCP more secure for our users, customers, and the internet at large. Even 3 years into the program, the submissions we are getting never cea…]]></summary>

To this moment, I co-authored teloxide and dptree, wrote several publications and translated a number of language release announcements. I also managed to write some production code in Rust, and had a chance to speak at one online meetup dedicated to Rust. Still, from time to time I find myself disputing with Rust’s borrow checker and type system for no practical reason. Yes, I am no longer stupefied by such errors as cannot return reference to temporary value – over time, I developed multiple heuristic strategies to cope with lifetimes…
But one recent situation has made me to fail ignominiously.

If you ask me - there’s pretty much nothing we can do that would suddenly make Emacs as popular as VS Code. But you know what - that’s perfectly fine. After all there are plenty of “modern” editors that are even less popular than Emacs, so clearly being “modern” doesn’t make you popular. And there’s also our “arch-nemesis” vim, that’s supposedly as “dated” as Emacs, but is extremely popular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we had Paul Copplestone from Supabase on The Changelog I asked him what a cloud native Postgres would look like. He replied,
Decoupled compute and storage. So the idea is that you should be able to attach the compute part of it to a storage, hopefully like an infinite storage; you know, anything that is infinitely scalable. If you can do this, and in particular, if the compute can start up very fast, maybe in, say, a hundred milliseconds via some sort of HTTP response, then that’s cloud native, yeah.
Enter Neon, which sells itself as:
The multi-cloud fully managed Postgres with a generous free tier. We separated storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage.
Behind this new business from MemSQL co-founder Nikita Shamgunov is the linked (Apache-licensed) server written in Rust.

How does the Pi Hole work though? The Pi Hole answers your computer’s DNS queries and if it is a domain on the blacklist, it sends the request to the Pi Web server.  This Web server just serves up a blank page.  So instead of loading the ad from the real domain, the blank page from the Pi is downloaded, thus “blocking” the ad or metric.
How effective is the setup, in practice?
Statistically speaking our household is averaging 15% of queries blocked and a spike over a bad weather weekend of 30% blocked. It is scary and incredible to think the number of ads and metrics forced upon us, and this number continues to increase. I am delighted with the Pi Hole project and am recommending it to all.

Graphite is an open-source CLI and code review dashboard built for engineers who want to write and review smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster. We cover all the details – how they got started, how this product emerged from another idea they were working on, the state of adoption, why stacking changes is the way of the future, how it’s just Git under the hood, and what they’re doing with the $20M in funding they just got from a16z.

Architecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.

DuckDuckGo, the privacy centric search firm have been found to be allowing Microsoft trackers through their browser. It’s dishonest, and I’m really disappointed.
Noteworthy: this is the DDG browser, which I’ve never used. Not the search engine. But still, this is concerning like Kev says:
DuckDuckGo tout themselves as being highly transparent and privacy respecting in everything they do. So to discover that they have been keeping this tidbit of information from their users — one that goes against the very fibre of the company — is a little concerning for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ken Kantzer was part of ~20 code audits of companies that had just raised their A or B rounds of funding:
It was fascinating work – we dove deep on a great cross-section of stacks and architectures, across a wide variety of domains. We found all sorts of security issues, ranging from catastrophic to just plain interesting. And we also had a chance to chat with senior engineering leadership and CTOs more generally about the engineering and product challenges they were facing as they were just starting to scale.
In this post he shares some of the more surprising things he’s learned from the experience. There’s a lot to digest in this post, but I’ll highlight my favorite to whet your whistle:
Simple Outperformed Smart. As a self-admitted elitist, it pains me to say this, but it’s true: the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to engineering. Cleverness for cleverness sake was abhorred. On the flip side, the companies where we were like ”woah, these folks are smart as hell” for the most part kind of faded.

Memory safety in Chrome is an ever-ongoing effort to protect our users. We are constantly experimenting with different technologies to stay ahead of malicious actors. In this spirit, this post is about our journey of using heap scanning technologies to improve memory safety of C++.




Let’s start at the beginning though. Throughout the lifetime of an application its state is generally represented in memory. Temporal memory safety refers to the problem of guaranteeing that memory is always accessed with the most up to date information of its structure, its type. C++ unfortunately does not provide such guarantees. While there is appetite for different languages than C++ with stronger memory safety guarantee…]]></summary>

Flat file web software is about having a set up which doesn’t use a “traditional” database. Instead it uses plain text files, other files, and/or maybe something like a json feed to store the data.
In this post, he explains why he thinks flat file web software is on the come up (again):
Flat file software can be powerful. Depending on what you need. And I think with the right developers and brain power behind the movement it can be more scalable and secure. The sky’s the limit. When I hear a developer saying, no, flat file isn’t good because… really all I’m hearing is they don’t want to change the way web software works. Because what I’ve found is most anything is possible.
Here’s a couple of flat file platforms which are incredible. One is a CMS/blog, the other a forum. Yes, a flat file forum.
A somewhat-related categorical question: Does SQLite count?
