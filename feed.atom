StreetPass is a browser extension that helps you find your people on Mastodon. It piggybacks off the way Mastodon handles decentralized identity verification and turns it into a simple discovery tool that recommends users based on the websites you visit! Available for Chrome and Firefox (soon Safari).
Discovery is one of the more challenging facets of federated social networking. It gets even more challenging now that Twitter’s API is getting paywall’d, so most of the free tools to port your Twitter social graph over to Mastodon will quit working. I expect more tools like StreetPass to pop up in the coming days as the Fediverse seems to be capturing that hacker spirit Twitter once embraced.

In the past 10 years, the median size for a desktop webpage has gone from 468 KB to 2284 KB, a 388.3% increase. For mobile, this jump is even more staggering — 145 KB to 2010 KB — a whopping 1288.1% increase.
That’s a lot of weight to ship over a network, especially for mobile. As a result, users experience terrible UX, slow loading times, and a lack of interactivity until everything is rendered. But all that code is necessary to make our sites work the way we want.
This is the problem with being a frontend dev today. What started out fun for frontend developers, building shit-hot sites with all the bells and whistles, has kinda turned into not fun. We’re now fighting different browsers to support, slow networks to ship code over, and intermittent, mobile connections. Supporting all these permutations is a giant headache.
How do we square this circle? By heading back to the server (Swiss basement not required).
He goes on to talk about isomorphic JavaScript frameworks and Deno’s offerings in this space. But hey, you don’t need all that fancy stuff to do SSR. All you need is a programming language that can render HTML (this is almost all languages) and a server…

Last May I left my job on the Go team at Google to experiment with more sustainable paths for open-source maintainers.

People like Filippo are still (unfortunately) the exception, not the rule. BUT! I’ll celebrate every time an open source maintainer makes it to the promised land, hopefully paving the way for others to follow after.
I’m sharing details about my progress to hopefully popularize the model, and eventually help other maintainers adopt it, although I’m not quite ready to recommend anyone else drop everything to try this just yet.

Since launching in 2016, Google's free OSS-Fuzz code testing service has helped get over 8800 vulnerabilities and 28,000 bugs fixed across 850 projects. Today, we’re happy to announce an expansion of our OSS-Fuzz Rewards Program, plus new features in OSS-Fuzz and our involvement in supporting academic fuzzing research. 
Refreshed OSS-Fuzz rewards 
  
The OSS-Fuzz project's purpose is to support the open source community in adopting fuzz testing, or fuzzing — an automated code testing technique for uncovering bugs in software. In addition to the OSS-Fuzz service, which provides a free platform for continuous fuzzing to critical open source projects, we established an OSS-Fuzz Reward Program in 2017 as part of our wider Patch Rewards Program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Richard MacManus from The New Stack spoke with Netlify CEO Matt Biilmann about the deal and their new catchphrase: “composable architectures”
Biilmann described it as a “change away from monolithic solutions,” citing a couple of examples: Adobe Experience Manager “as the DXP [digital experience platform] system for all your web productions” and Drupal “as the core engine that both powers the backend and the frontend of your site, the business logic and the UI layer, and so on.” He argues that these types of “monolithic” solutions can “start to feel very legacy and very dated.”
I’m not sure if “composable architectures” will stick, but they sure did a good job of making “jamstack” a thing, so time will tell on that.

The theory goes that if you ship code on Friday you’ll inevitably be working Saturday to fix what you broke. This makes logical sense; software is messy and mistakes are unavoidable.
But no, shipping code on Friday isn’t bad. At least, it doesn’t have to be.
The key to their success is confidence, which comes from having a solid deployment pipeline and shipping through it often. Gerhard Lazu hit that nail on the head in this short clip as well.

I’ve pair-programmed in a lot of different situations. I’ve been the junior developer who needed to be unblocked. I’ve been the new team member, being onboarded to a new codebase. I’ve paired with peers for knowledge-sharing and productivity. And I’ve been the senior dev.
He goes on to say that it’s easy to put a pairing session on rails to avoid embarrassment, but:
When I think back, my favorite pair-programming sessions were the one where things went wrong. These were the moments that taught me what being a programmer is all about. What do you do when you don’t know what to do? How do you break down a new problem? What tools do you reach for? When do you abandon your current approach? These are things you can’t learn from a blog post.

SQL should be the first option considered for new data engineering work. It’s robust, fast, future-proof and testable. With a bit of care, it’s clear and readable. A new SQL engine - DuckDB - makes SQL competitive with other high performance dataframe libraries, making SQL a good candidate for data of all sizes.
You can make a similar argument for SQL that Gary Bernhardt made for Vim. Here’s Gary on Vim, run your own s/Vim/SQL/g filter on this as you read it:
…just for me, 15 years; at the beginning of that time, TextMate was just becoming popular. Then it was Sublime Text was cool. Then Atom was cool. Then VS Code was cool. A lot of people switched between two of those, three of those, maybe all four of those, and that whole time I was just getting better and better and better at Vim… And you multiply that out by the length of a career, you use Vim for 40 years - you’re gonna be so good at it by the end, and it’s still gonna be totally relevant, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chip Huyen:
When we actively hire, our startup gets 150 - 200 applications each month. I read every single one of them. Sometimes, I’d talk to a candidate and see that what we perceived as their strongest aspects actually weren’t included in their resume. Occasionally, a candidate would tell me that they didn’t expect their resume to still be screened by humans – had they known, they would have written their resume differently.
The resume evaluation process is pretty much a black box for most candidates. And it is so because few hiring managers have publicly discussed this. I thought I should start the conversation.
Chip’s team mostly hires for infra and ML roles, so some of the advice here will be catered towards those positions. Still, if you’re on the job market you’d be well-served by spending 15-20 minutes reading this post and tweaking your resume where applicable.

Florian talks about how they evaluated AWS, GCP & Azure before they settled on the platform that met their requirements.

Right now in the UK and across the world, things are uncertain. Companies are laying workers off, there’s a cost of living and energy crisis. I’m excruciatingly lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to develop the skillset I’ve got. In times like these every signal is telling me to stay on the path I’m on, enjoying the comfort and safety of a high paying job.
I’m not going to listen. I’m quitting and I’m leaving this place. I’ll see you in the mountains.
After this post blew up, Seán wrote a follow-up on what quitting the rat race means to him.

Databases and web apps go together like peanut butter and jelly. In a word, they’re inseparable. And despite all the amazing innovations in NoSQL data stores, often a good old relational database is the most reliable tool for the job.
We want to make it completely seamless to develop applications that need databases on Replit. Starting today, you can create and instantly begin to use PostgreSQL databases from within the Replit workspace.
The fine print.
Under the hood, this product is powered by our friends at Neon who have created a lightning-fast serverless database. The database will go to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity. Most clients should handle the reconnection seamlessly.

SQLite is sometimes used as the core of a client/server database system. While it works reliably well in such cases, the database backend module that it uses to store b-tree structures in its database file was not designed with this case in mind and can be improved upon in several ways. The HC-tree (hctree) project is an attempt to develop a new database backend that improves upon regular SQLite as follows…
It improves concurrency, adds support for replication & removes database size limitations.

LangChain is designed to help with prompts, chains (sequences of calls), data augmented generation, agents, memory & evaluation tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tyler Cipriani read “‘Did you miss my comments or what?’ Understanding Toxicity in Open Source Discussions,” and learned about entitlement:
The term is new (to me), but the paper renders a familiar scene, “The author is usually visibly upset about not being able to use the tool, often complaining about wasted time.”
The situation is all-too-common and exhausting. And when it happens over-and-over, maintainers give up.
It made me wonder: why have I never seen “entitlement” in a code of conduct?
Good question…

Engineers looked forward to the Tech Debt Friday. The team would happily remind management that this day cannot (under any circumstances) be planned for regular feature/bugfix work. Although we fixed some bugs along the way, this was primarily an investment to make future feature development cheaper while improving the maintainability and reliability.
Initially it was hard to defend spending 10% of the team bandwidth on tech debt, but over time the payback was huge
He goes on to list eight things that happened as result of this policy. Good stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are the technical co-founder or early engineering lead at a startup, and you want to talk about your microservices, hand-rolled CI/CD, in-house monitoring stack, or any other unique part of your stack, I will say: Cool. Let’s riff. Take me deep, I’m ready.
But there’s something I’m likely to tell you in return, something I’ll probably insist you’re overlooking and need to internalize as soon as possible: Your technology stack is not the product.
It’s easy to get too focused on our tech and tools. Sometimes we think it’s our competitive advantage, other times it’s merely personal fascination and intellectual stimulation. This post is a good reminder:
A mindset of technology being the means, not the end, is uncomfortable. But it will help you stay focused on what matters most (the product and your customers), avoid wasteful misadventures, and maximize the company’s chance of success.

I wanted to give them control over their data and to be able to store it locally to open and edit later. And also easily share it with other people. It’s easy to do this by supporting file upload/download, but I wanted something simpler, like the ability to share by sending a url. I also didn’t want to store anything on the backend (at least for the free tier).
What he decided on was to base64 encode the entire application state and store it in the fragment section of the URL. I love all the upsides of this approach and it’s pretty trivial to accomplish. Here’s the pseudocode that Scott provides in his post:
const stateString = JSON.stringify(appState); // appState is a json object
const compressed = compress(stateString);
const encoded = Base64.encode(compressed);
// Push that `encoded` string to the url
// ... Later, on page load or on undo/redo we read the url and
// do the following
const decoded = Base64.decode(encoded); // same encoded as above, but read from url
const uncompressed = uncompress(decoded);
const newState = JSON.parse(uncompressed);
// Now load your application with the newState

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cedric Chin, writing about the famous adage that says “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”
At some level, this is self-evident. Goodhart’s Law is about as pithy and about as practicable as “the only certainty in life is death and taxes” and “hell is other people.” It is descriptive; it tells you of the existence of a phenomenon, but it doesn’t tell you what to do about it or how to solve it.
There are more useful formulations of the law that help solve it. Some organizations use this narrower, more actionable form:
When people are pressured to meet a target value there are three ways they can proceed:
They can work to improve the system
They can distort the system
Or they can distort the data
With that framing in hand, Cedric goes on to describe how you can solve for these three ways and design incentive/measurement systems that work.

We are pleased to announce that moving forward, the Chromium project is going to support the use of third-party Rust libraries from C++ in Chromium. To do so, we are now actively pursuing adding a production Rust toolchain to our build system. This will enable us to include Rust code in the Chrome binary within the next year. We’re starting slow and setting clear expectations on what libraries we will consider once we’re ready. 
In this blog post, we will discuss how we arrived at the decision to support third-party Rust libraries at this time, and not broader usage of Rust in Chromium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long-standing debate between me and a peer at work has been how we should name services. His position was always that services should be named something descriptive, so that you can infer from the name what it does. My position is that the name should definitely not be descriptive, but should be something cute and wholly disconnected from the purpose. And I think this applies more broadly to projects and companies, too.
Nicholas’ reason for cute names winning comes down to the inevitably of change in a service/project’s function and the difficulty in renaming things. I hadn’t thought of that argument, but I already agreed with the premise.
We also apply this thinking to podcast episode names, which can be a mixed bag because descriptive titles certainly help when it comes to discovery. As Adam and I discussed on our recent State of the “log” episode, if you see use a descriptive title, it’s most likely because we couldn’t think of a good cute/interesting one.
But that’s just our opinion about episode naming. What do you prefer?

We are not suppliers. All the people writing and maintaining these projects, we are not suppliers. We do not have a business relationship with all these organisations.

He goes on to discuss how, importantly, licenses such as the MIT point this out (in all caps):
If you use this, I owe you nothing. At all. We have no relationship. I put this up online on the condition that if you use it, all the risks are on you… So all your Software Supply Chain ideas? You are not buying from a supplier, you are a raccoon digging through dumpsters for free code. So I would advise you to put these rules in the same dumpster. And remember. I am not a supplier.
That raccoon line reminds me of a now-ancient meme you might still enjoy…

Just yesterday, I asked “What options does Linux offer for fast RAID 0 software RAID?” and I had an entire conversation that settled on Btrfs as a good option and I learned how to create and configure the array, mount it, and most importantly scrub it for errors. I’ll still use ZFS, of course. But, I’ve never had that experience using Google (nor can you).
…according to a report by Semafor, Microsoft Corp is discussing the possibility of acquiring OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT. The tech-industry giant is ready to pay upwards of $10 billion for the acquisition.
Clearly, Microsoft sees the bigger picture here for Bing, Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, and more. This also speaks to the conversation we had with Swyx about AI’s future being tied to capitalism and eventually being controlled by the FAANGs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tim McNamara makes an important distinction that is often lost on us:
Agile doesn’t make your team magically speed up its ability to close tickets. Instead, it speeds up the team’s decision-making process. It’s about orientation, not velocity. An agile workflow is one where you are able to quickly adjust direction based on short feedback cycles.
Mat, Natalie & I touched on this when they dragged me on to Go Time last summer to share some thoughts on velocity. Worth a (re)listen if you’re in to such things.
