        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why another file manager? I wanted something simple and minimalistic. Something to help me with faster navigation in the filesystem; a cd and ls replacement. So I build “llama”. It allows for quick navigation with fuzzy searching. cd integration is quite simple. And you can open vim right from the llama. That’s it. As simple and dumb as a llama.

        <id>changelog.com/news/mlj3</id>
        <link href="https://westling.dev/b/extremely-linear-git"/>
        <updated>2022-11-23T14:36:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An interesting idea from Gustav Westling…
One of the things that I like to do in my projects, is to make the git history as linear as possible.
Usually this means to rebase commits onto the main branch, but it can also mean to only allow merges in one direction, from feature branches into main, never the other way around. It kind of depends on the project.
Today I’m taking this one step further, and I’m introducing a new concept: extremely linear git history.
With our extremely linear history, the first commit in a repo hash a hash that starts with 0000000, the second commit is 0000001, the third is 0000002, and so on!
How he accomplishes this is perhaps even more interesting (and hacky!)

Twitter supposedly lost around 80% of its work force. What ever the real number is, there are whole teams with out engineers on it now. Yet, the website goes on and the tweets keep coming. This left a lot wondering what exactly was going on with all those engineers and made it seem like it was all just bloat. I’d like to explain my little corner of Twitter (though it wasn’t so little) and some of the work that went on that kept this thing running.
This is a detailed post about Twitter’s caching system that Matthew and others built while working there, and it’s brilliantly summed up by commenter Johnny Manu40:
When everything works fine, they wonder why they hired you. When everything stops working, they wonder why they hired you. I.T. in a nutshell.

I’ve become convinced that “little languages”—small languages designed to solve very specific problems—are the future of programming, particularly after reading Gabriella Gonzalez’s The end of history for programming and watching Alan Kay’s Programming and Scaling talk.
Examples of “little languages” include SQL and regular expressions. In the old days we called these DSLs, but the author argues that term has become overloaded and I have a hard time disagreeing with that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In your company, who designs the end-to-end developer experience? From design to implementation, what is the developer experience that you actually ship? Even though the average developer wastes almost half of their working hours because of bad DX, many of us don’t even know what that means, or how to improve it.
Kenneth Auchenberg is working at Stripe, building economic infrastructure for the internet. Gerhard found his perspective on Developer Experience Infrastructure (DXI) refreshingly simple, as well as very useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the old saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In the software world, an open source alternative is the sincerest form of imitation. Well, Retool (a Changelog sponsor) can consider themselves flattered, because Openblocks sets out to do openly what they’ve been doing proprietarily. Here’s why:
It’s cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.
Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.
Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.
Openblocks wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Openblocks is
An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.
A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
A domain-specific language that UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might a “modular monolith” be the happy middle ground in the endless monolith or microservices decision? You may have to answer that question for yourself, but this post shares some good thoughts around designing a modular monolith:
When designing a modular monolith, it is all about breaking up the system into modules, and then combining those modules into a monolith for deployment.
It might be worth noting that finding what modules you will need, might not be as easy as you would think. They have to be as independent as possible. High-cohesion and low coupling is very important here, as all communication between the modules might end up being a cross network call, if you decide to break it into services in the future.
This means that all communication between modules need to well abstracted, and be either asynchronous, so that they can handle the call going across the network in the future, or use some form of messaging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technology has an unmistakable impact on society — the way we work, learn and play have all changed significantly over the past decade. As SVP of Technology and Society, part of my work at Google is connecting people and ideas to help shape the future of our most ambitious technology and its impact on society, and to do it responsibly.


An important part of that is talking to and learning from experts in a variety of fields and disciplines. Recently I sat down with a brilliant friend, New York Times columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman, to compare notes and discuss some big questions on our minds.




Thomas Friedman and James Manyika in conversation at Google’s Bay View campus.



We had a lot to cover, as it had been a couple of years since our last such in-person conversation due to the pandemic. Much of our discussion focused on AI and how it affects society, but we also discussed what Tom has been observing, how we as a society shape technology, and why we think this moment in time is an inflection point akin to the printing press or the industrial revolution.


To close our conversation, I asked Tom what keeps him optimistic about the future. His answer reinforces my belief that getting technology right is a collective responsibility involving the whole of society — from open, honest conversations like this to better understand the opportunities and challenges, to defining policy, and responsibly creating new and societally-beneficial applications.


I always learn something new when I have these conversations with Tom, and I’m excited to share more insights and dialogues on YouTube soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s see if this ages well, but I do agree that Armin shares some good points. Scale comes with mainstream, and mainstream Mastodon isn’t quite possible if we can’t all agree (and we can’t). This is probably Mastodon’s most obvious achilles heel — agreement in a decentralized, federated, you can “do what you want” world.
…before we even hit the issue of the technology, we hit the issue of there being absolutely no agreement of what the thing should look like or what the issue actually is and that’s I think much more interesting.
Some people claim the solution to the technical scalability issue is huge instances, some other people have the belief that the actual intended design and solution were micro-instances of in extreme cases a user each.
Then there’s moderation, which if you’ve ever run any community forums, Slacks, etc you’ll know that you’re going to have to moderate and deal with people problems.
On the topic of moderation the very same issue is even more absurd. Some instances want uncontrolled free speech where some instances effectively are pure shit-posting instances which are completely de-federated from the most of the fediverse as a result. Other instances really like to control their content, where some popular ones such as fosstodon ban all languages than English as a result to allow moderation. There also is no real agreement on if larger or smaller instance are going to make the problem of moderation better or worse.

At the same time, we launched a central Responsible Innovation team to ensure the rest of Google is held accountable to these AI Principles. As the team grows, we continue to incorporate the perspectives and ideas of people from around the world — and this spring we welcomed our first intern, Lieke Dom. Lieke is based in Amsterdam, recently got her Master’s in Digital Business & Innovation, and is completing her Master’s in Applied Ethics.


I sat down with Lieke to learn more about her experience so far, including how her educational career led her here and what she’s learned from the internship.

After a six-year adrenaline high on Heroku, Adam needed time to recover and refill the creative well. So, he moved to Berlin, did some gig work with companies…dabbled in investing and advising. But he wasn’t satisfied. Adam likes to build things.
Ultimately, he was just waiting for the right time to reconnect with James Lindenbaum and Orion Henry — the same fellas he created Heroku with. Eventually they founded Ink & Switch, an independent research lab which led to innovations that made Muse possible. Muse is a tool for deep work and thinking on iPad and Mac. Today’s show is all about that journey and the details in-between.

Today we celebrate the thirteenth birthday of the Go open source release. The Gopher is a teenager!
It’s been an eventful year for Go. The most significant event was the release of Go 1.18 in March, which brought many improvements but most notably Go workspaces, fuzzing, and generics.
He goes on to describe many of the other notable features and events of the past year and closes with a glance into Go’s future:
In Go’s 14th year, we’ll keep working to make Go the best environment for software engineering at scale. We plan to focus particularly on supply chain security, improved compatibility, and structured logging, all of which have been linked already in this post. And there will be plenty of other improvements as well, including profile-guided optimization.

In the future, instead of everyone sharing the same search engine, you’ll have your completely individual, personalized Mike or Julia or Jarvis - the AI. Instead of being scared to share information with it, you will volunteer your data, knowing its incentives align with yours. The more you tell your assistant, the better it can help you, so when you ask it to recommend a good restaurant nearby, it’ll provide options based on what you like to eat and how far you want to drive. Ask it for a good coffee maker, and it’ll recommend choices within your budget from your favorite brands with only your best interests in mind. The search will be personal and contextual and excitingly so!

Imagine hundreds of developers shipping on an average day 300 changes into a system which processes $100,000,000 worth of transactions on a quiet week. If you think this is hard, consider the context: a government institution which must comply with all laws & regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adam Gordon Bell:
There are many ways to understand how containers work, but most useful explanations are actually simplifications….
But for me, containers are just chrooted processes. Sure, they are more than that: Containers have a nice developer experience, an open-source foundation, and a whole ecosystem of cloud-native companies pushing them forward. But, let me show you why I think chroot is the key.
I like this framing. It makes a lot of sense to me. More than ‘lightweight VM’, which is how I’ve thought about them previously. The rest of this article is Adam stepping through the process of building a container runtime using only the chroot system call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rachel Stephens, trying to reconcile the claims that the tech industry is vastly overstaffed with other claims of vast resource scarcity:
Both things can be true: it’s not a clear over- or under-staffing problem. It’s a problem of proportionality. There can definitely be organizational bloat… At the same time, there are also areas in tech that remain chronically understaffed and under-resourced: OSS project maintainers, people working on-call support, and people writing documentation to name a few.
An interesting analysis with a much-needed call for kindness to our fellow nerds as they face these tumultuous times.
And (I can’t believe I’m writing this, but the jokes about Twitter layoffs in particular keep coming at a surprising rate) be kind to people facing layoffs. Losing your job is awful in the best of circumstances; going through it in such a public and charged situation must be emotionally grueling. Be kind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apropos of nothing 😉
Mastodon, a decentralized microblogging site named after an extinct type of mammoth, recorded 120,000 new users in the four days following billionaire Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, its German-born founder Eugen Rochko tells TIME. Many of them were Twitter users seeking a new place to call their online home.
Those users, whether they knew it or not, were following in the footsteps of Rochko, 29, who began coding Mastodon in 2016 after becoming disillusioned with Twitter. “I was thinking that being able to express myself online to my friends through short messages was very important to me, important also to the world, and that maybe it should not be in the hands of a single corporation,” Rochko says. “It was generally related to a feeling of distrust of the top down control that Twitter exercised.”
Adam and I first spoke with Eugen in 2018 (before it was cool) and even signed up on his instance, but haven’t started posting there… yet. I’m a bit skeptical of its ability to scale beyond technologist circles. But maybe that’s okay?

We talk through the beginnings of Heroku, the v1 most people have forgotten about, the era of web hosting back in 2008-2010, the serendipity of Silicon Vally in those days, pitching to Y Combinator, the makings of git push heroku, the Heroku style and name, the sale of Heroku to Salesforce, potential regrets — and we tee up part 2 coming next week with Adam going beyond Heroku and the story of Muse.

Note: The three vulnerabilities discussed in this blog were all fixed in Samsung’s March 2021 release. They were fixed as CVE-2021-25337, CVE-2021-25369, CVE-2021-25370. To ensure your Samsung device is up-to-date under settings you can check that your device is running SMR Mar-2021 or later.

As defenders, in-the-wild exploit samples give us important insight into what attackers are really doing. We get the “ground truth” data about the vulnerabilities and exploit techniques they’re using, which then informs our further research and guidance to security teams on what could have the biggest impact or return on investment. To do this, we need to know that the vulnerabilities and exploit samples were found in-the-wild. Over the past few years there’s been tremendo…]]></summary>

we are now faced with an embarrassment of CSS riches, and it can be hard to catch up. CSS Grid started being supported in major browsers almost five years ago, yet I still check a reference every time I use it. And as cool as subgrid seems, I’ve yet to even try it out.
Perhaps CSS is even starting to reach over into areas best handled by HTML or JavaScript?

Bandwidth means, once things get going, how fast you can download. But “once things get going” can take a really long time. In fact, it can take longer than the whole download! This is especially true for simple web pages, or web pages made up of a bunch of tiny pieces, which is very common on today’s web… That’s where latency comes in.

Back then, many people in the AI community were excited about the potential of neural networks, which were impressive, but couldn’t yet accomplish important, real-world tasks. I was excited, too! I did my senior thesis on using parallel computation to train neural networks, thinking we only needed 32X more compute power to get there. I was way off. At that time, we needed 1 million times as much computational power.


A short 21 years later, with exponentially more computational power, it was time to take another crack at neural networks. In 2011, I and a few others at Google started training very large neural networks using millions of randomly selected frames from videos online. The results were remarkable. Without ex…]]></summary>

Today, we have a slew of dangerous practices that compromise the robustness and maintainability of software. Nearly all modern programming languages have some form of null references, shared global state, and functions with side effects—things that are far worse than the GOTO ever was.
How can those flaws be eliminated? It turns out that the answer has been around for decades: purely functional programming languages.

Liz Rice and I spoke about pets & cattle recently on The Changelog. I asked her, “from your perspective, are the people still doing it the old-school pets way?”
This tool is a great example of Pets-style administration being alive and well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Felix Wilhelm, Project Zero

Earlier this year, I discovered a surprising attack surface hidden deep inside Java’s standard library: A custom JIT compiler processing untrusted XSLT programs, exposed to remote attackers during XML signature verification. This post discusses CVE-2022-34169, an integer truncation bug in this JIT compiler resulting in arbitrary code execution in many Java-based web applications and identity providers that support the SAML single-sign-on standard. 
OpenJDK fixed the discussed issue in July 2022. The Apache BCEL project used by Xalan-J, the origin of the vulnerable code, released a patch in September 2022. 

While the vulnerability discussed in this post has been patched , vendors and users should expect further vulnerabilities in SAML.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Simon Willison describes the Perfect Commit as a single commit that contains all of the following:
The implementation: a single, focused change
Tests that demonstrate the implementation works
Updated documentation reflecting the change
A link to an issue thread providing further context
Here’s four paragraphs on how he got to here:
I went through a several year phase of writing essays in my commit messages, trying to capture as much of the background context and thinking as possible.
My commit messages grew a lot shorter when I started bundling the updated documentation in the commit—since often much of the material I’d previously included in the commit message was now in that documentation instead.
As I extended my practice of writing issue threads, I found that they were a better place for most of this context than the commit messages themselves. They supported embedded media, were more discoverable and I could continue to extend them even after the commit had landed.
Today many of my commit messages are a single line summary and a link to an issue!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re feeling the FOMO of JavaScript or you’re writing “spaghetti code” just to do something a NextJS component would do out of the box, then read this post from Bill Prin on why he moved from Django to NextJS.
The summary is that using a language like Python or Ruby for a significant web project has increasingly gotten less reasonable over time to the point where now, in 2022, it’s getting hard to justify. By not keeping your web stack in pure Javascript, you are making your life unnecessarily difficult (as usual, we’ll include languages like TypeScript as part of the JavaScript ecosystem). You will almost certainly invest a bunch of time-solving problems that would be automatically solved for you if you just stuck with JavaScript.
I will provide specific examples of solving problems using Django that would have been trivially solved in NextJS.
He goes on to share two reasons why you should use Python or Ruby for web projects in 2022.
You’re working on an existing project that hasn’t been migrated yet or is not worth migrating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tldr from Guilherme Rambo is enough, but read the full post for all the details.
TL;DR: Any app with access to Bluetooth could record your conversations with Siri and audio from the iOS keyboard dictation feature when using AirPods or Beats headsets. This would happen without the app requesting microphone access permission and without the app leaving any trace that it was listening to the microphone.
This bug has since been handled by Apple. Also, after reaching back out to Apple (on Oct 25), Guilherme was told he’d be receiving a $7,000 (USD) bug bounty payment for reporting the issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By James Forshaw, Project Zero

I've been spending a lot of time researching Windows authentication implementations, specifically Kerberos. In June 2022 I found an interesting issue number 2310 with the handling of RC4 encryption that allowed you to authenticate as another user if you could either interpose on the Kerberos network traffic to and from the KDC or directly if the user was configured to disable typical pre-authentication requirements.

This blog post goes into more detail on how this vulnerability works and how I was able to exploit it with only a bare minimum of brute forcing required. Note, I'm not going to spend time fully explaining how Kerberos authentication works, there's plenty of resources online. For example this blog post by Steve Syfuhs who works at Microsoft is a …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Wikman on what it takes to learn software development and how he responds when people ask him how they should go about it:
At the time I was learning, I didn’t have access to any kind of bigger picture. I had limited resources. Limited documentation. I had so many limitations. I ran into them constantly and eventually found the next thing I could use to do cool stuff. If you try to teach someone to use an HTML form today, you will need to decide if you are talking about the basic idea or reality. Do we need to cover CSRF, captchas and how to do it in React? How about the backend? Starting out, I didn’t hear about half of the things I didn’t know; I think that made things easier.
When it comes to the software industry, this is the best of times. There are amazing learning resources available, a vast repository of free code that you don’t have to write, and lucrative job offers on the other end of the chasm.
When it comes to the software industry, this is the worst of times. There are too many learning resources to choose from, a crippling repository of free code that might stumble you, and overwhelming imposter syndrome on the other end of the chasm.
Lars sums it up nicely:
Hand someone a fish and they’ll never know that the ocean is vast. Teach them how to fish and they’ll be forever lost at sea.

While researching genomics has the potential to save lives and preserve people’s quality of life, it's incredibly challenging work.
Back in January, we announced a partnership with PacBio, a developer of genome sequencing instruments, to further advance genomic technologies. Today, PacBio is introducing the Revio sequencing system, an instrument that runs on our deep learning technology, DeepConsensus. With DeepConsensus built right into Revio, researchers can quickly and accurately identify genetic variants that cause diseases.
