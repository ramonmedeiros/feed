Many web applications need to display user-controlled content. This can be as simple as serving user-uploaded images (e.g. profile photos), or as complex as rendering user-controlled HTML (e.g. a web development tutorial). This has always been difficult to do securely, so we’ve worked to find easy, but secure solutions that can be applied to most types of web applications. 

Classical Solutions for Isolating Untrusted Content
“sandbox domains”. The basic idea is that if your application's main domain is example.com, you could serve all untrusted content on exampleusercontent.com. Since these two domains are cross-site, any malicious content on exampleusercontent.com can’t impact example.com. 


This approach can…]]></summary>

Chokepoint Capitalism is about how big tech and big content have captured creative labor markets and the ways we can win them back. We talk about chokepoints creating chickenized reverse-centaurs, paying for your robot boss (think Uber, Doordash, Amazon Drivers), the chickenization that’s climbing the priviledge gradient from the most blue collar workers to the middle-class. There are chokepoints in open source, AI generative art, interoperability, music, film, and media. To quote Cory, “We’re all fighting the same fight.”

High profile open source vulnerabilities have made it clear that securing the supply chains underpinning modern software is an urgent, yet enormous, undertaking. As supply chains get more complicated, enterprise developers need to manage the tidal wave of vulnerabilities that propagate up through dependency trees. Open source maintainers need streamlined ways to vet proposed dependencies and protect their projects. A rise in attacks coupled with increasingly complex supply chains means that supply chain security problems need solutions on the ecosystem level. 


One way developers can manage this enormous risk is by choosing a more secure language. As part of Google’s commitment to advancing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Jesper Sarnesjo and Nicky Ringland, Google Open Source Security Team


Today, we are excited to announce the deps.dev API, which provides free access to the deps.dev dataset of security metadata, including dependencies, licenses, advisories, and other critical health and security signals for more than 50 million open source package versions.


Software supply chain attacks are increasingly common and harmful, with high profile incidents such as Log4Shell, Codecov, and the recent 3CX hack. The overwhelming complexity of the software ecosystem causes trouble for even the most diligent and well-resourced developers.

While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.
I’ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them. The file is found in every version of macOS from Mojave (10.14.0) to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isn’t in High Sierra (10.13) or earlier.
Well that’s a fun bit of trivia! But why?
Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? The filename is “simpledoc.pdf” and it’s only 184 KB. Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.

This is because there are easy (yet non-obvious) ways to make negative progress as a developer. It’s not hard to move orders of magnitude faster than someone who’s headed in the wrong direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running live demos can be stressful. You know what you want to say and show. You prepare the CLI commands you want to run to best showcase what you’ve built, but then you waste time typing long commands; you make typos; the commands fail or take way too long to complete. Maybe they depend on external system (network, APIs, cloud, …) and of course it’s not cooperating while you’re running your live demo.
Here’s how you can avoid all of the above by scripting, automating and recording your demos, so that you never have to stress about showcasing ever again…

few  patches that completely removed XUL layout from the Firefox codebase.


 This means that (modulo a few exceptions documented below) all the Firefox UI is using regular web technology to render (mostly CSS flexbox).


 This was a rather big effort (first filed 9 years ago in bug 1033225), and I wanted to document some of the things that I learned during the process, some of the things and decisions that made it possible, and some of the things that I would’ve maybe done differently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Schepanovski:
I always thought of 1+N as a thing that you just keep in your head, catch on code reviews or via performance regressions. This worked well for a long time, however, the less control we have over our SQL queries the more likely it will sneak through those guards…
I tumbled on a couple of 1+Ns while reading a project code for an unrelated reason and it got me thinking – do I ever want Django to do that lazy loading stuff? And the answer was never.
Turns out the implementation of this is quite easy. ~15 loc for the naive version and ~35 for a more robust version. Give it a try if you, like Alex, never want to allow a 1+N in your Django app again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This open letter by the Future of Life institute has been signed by 1380 people (so far) including notable technologists such as Steve Wozniak, Stuart Russell, Emad Mostaque (Stability AI) & Elon Musk.
Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that “At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.” We agree. That point is now.
Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ALOHA stands for “A Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation”, which is certainly a stretch in terms of acronym, but the project itself is so cool that I don’t think it really matters… Here’s the pitch:
Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface.
