        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This hit my radar a few times in the past year – this week, and then most recently a few months back when we had Richard Hipp on The Changelog (again) – but, I didn’t post it to the newsfeed.
Here’s what’s interesting about the SQLite test suite – it’s their secret sauce…the sustaining enablement of building a support business around SQLite. Here’s a direct quote from Richard Hipp in that episode.
Originally we thought we were gonna sell this and make money from it, and that’s how we were gonna support ongoing development. That didn’t really play out, nobody ever bought it. It does sort of become our business value, our intellectual property. I mean, you can take the SQLite code and fork it and start your own thing…but you don’t have the full test suite. You’ve got a lot of tests, but not all of them. So we’ve got a little bit of advantage over you there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re a fan of Easter eggs in software, you won’t find them in the curl codebase. Daniel explains, “There are no Easter eggs in curl. For the good.” The parimary reason is “trust,” but also to not waste time and effort on “useless work.”
If we would allow an Easter egg to get merged, we would soon start getting improvements to the egg code and people would like to add more eggs and to change the existing one. We would spend time and effort on the silly parts and we would need to spend testing and energy on these jokes instead of the real thing. We already have enough work without adding irrelevant work to the pile.
Given the massive usage of curl, I agree with the all business approach that Daniel desires and promises.

Turns out using WebAssembly to isolate potentially-buggy code is a pretty big win:
Going forward, we can treat these modules as untrusted code, and — assuming we did it right — even a zero-day vulnerability in any of them should pose no threat to Firefox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jacob Kaplan-Moss, who has been writing a lot about good interview questions and how to hire well:
Work sample tests are an exercise, a simulation, a small slice of real day-to-day work that we ask candidates to perform. They’re practical, hands-on, and very close or even identical to actual tasks the person would perform if hired. They’re also small, constrained, and simplified enough to be fair to include in a job selection process.
To give you a more concrete idea of what I’m talking about, here are several examples of work sample tests I’ve used…
And just in case you think he’s prescribing whiteboarding…
However, work sample tests are also a minefield: the space is littered with silly practices like whiteboarding, FizzBuzz, Leetcode, and “reverse a linked list”-style bullshit. The point of this series is to separate these silly practices from the good ones and to give you a framework and several examples to use in your hiring rounds.

It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to elasticsearch which requires a couple dozen knobs to understand and tune.
It is a drop-in replacement for elasticsearch if you are just ingesting data using APIs and searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported with zinc. Zinc provides its own UI).

Whenever you find yourself arguing for improving infrastructure by yanking up complexity, you need to be very careful.
He applies this thinking to a common technical proposal of switching from a general-purpose RDBMS to a specialty database to account for growth and scale.
I’m a proponent of mastering and abusing existing tools, rather than chasing greener pastures. The more facility you gain with first-principle reasoning and napkin math, the closer I’d wager you’ll inch towards this conclusion as well. A new system theoretically having better guarantees is not enough of an argument. Adding a new system to your stack is a huge deal and difficult to undo.

Kubernetes Security is constantly evolving - keeping pace with enhanced functionality, usability and flexibility while also balancing the security needs of a wide and diverse set of use-cases.
Recently, the GKE Security team discovered a high severity vulnerability that allowed workloads to have access to parts of the host filesystem outside the mounted volumes boundaries. Although the vulnerability was patched back in September we thought it would be beneficial to write up a more in-depth analysis of the issue to share with the community.

… we found ourselves increasingly forcing existing systems out of the comfort of their design centers, we wondered: was our assumption of using an existing system wrong? Should we in fact be exploring our own de novo operating system? In particular, our colleague Cliff Biffle, who had a ton of experience with both Rust and embedded systems, had a vision for what such a system might look like (namely, the system that he had always wanted for himself!). Cliff dove into a sketch of his ideas, giving the nascent system a name that felt perfectly apt: Hubris.
There’s some serious innovation going on at Oxide and I can’t wait to see what they do next.

We cover the early days of Electron before Electron was Electron, how she advocated to turn it into a product and make it a framework, how it’s used today, why she boomeranged back to GitHub to lead Sponsors, what’s next in funding open source creators, and we attempt to answer the question “what happens to open source once it’s funded?”

When I hit the Real World I quickly ran into many practical use cases where a regular expression helped me solve a problem. That’s when I finally grokked them.
If you want to improve your understanding (and deployment of) regular expressions to solve problems, but don’t have a use case at the moment… here’s a whole bunch of them for you to practice on in the meantime.

If you like a good yak shake, listening to this one is a lot more fun than doing it.
Gerhard is most excited about the Ship It Christmas gifts that we have been preparing for you. While GitHub Codespaces is not going to be part of the upcoming Christmas special episode, today’s talk covers why investing in a Codespaces integration is worth it.
Changelog #459 and Backstage #20 are related to this topic.

Kuby lowers the bar of adopting Kubernetes for Rails apps, leveraging the power of the convention-over-configuration principle. Just as Rails conquered the world with its “build a blog in 15 minutes” idea, so too could Kuby reign supreme in the context of deployment—”deploy Rails on Kubernetes in 15 minutes”.

And our work is definitely not done, because the internet changes so quickly. About 15% of searches we see are entirely new every day. And when it comes to other types of information beyond words, in many ways, technology hasn’t even begun to scratch the surface of what’s possible. Take one example: sign language.
The task is daunting. There are as many sign languages as there are spoken languages around the world. That’s why, when we started exploring how we could better support sign language, we started small by researching and experimenting with what machine learning models could recognize.

One is a toolkit for building and deploying containers and the other is a package and configuration manager. However, these tools do have some overlap: they can both be used to create reproducible environments.
While both tools aim to solve this problem, they take different approaches.
A solid rundown of the different approaches these two tools take, and how you might think about picking which one to use. Maybe you can have the best of both worlds?

A monolithic approach is followed: we try to implement features of commonly used libraries (in the web application context) natively in Rust to replace native Node addons, improve performance and reduce duplicated code. Blueboat’s architecture ensures the security of the platform, prevents code duplication and keeps the overhead low.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Property-based tests give us more confidence in our code. They’re great at catching edge-cases we may not have thought of otherwise. But this confidence comes at a cost. Property tests take more effort to write. They force you to think hard about what the code is doing, and what its expected behaviour should be. It’s hard work. And on top of that, running 100+ tests is always going to take longer than running 3–5 example-based tests. This cost is real, and it raises the question:
How do we keep ourselves from over-specifying or writing unnecessary tests?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fascinating look at the state of packaging apps for the Linux desktop:
The stability of the Linux desktop has dramatically improved in recent years. Core library developers are finally seeing the benefits of maintaining compatibility. Despite this, many developers are not interested in depending on a stable base of libraries for binary software. Instead, they have decided to ignore and override almost all libraries pre-installed on the user’s system.
And why the author thinks Flatpak (which some believe is the future) is not the way to go.
I am not a fan. I’m going to outline here some of the technical, security and usability problems with Flatpak and others. I’ll try to avoid addressing “fixable” problems (like theming) and instead focus on fundamental problems inherent in their design. I aim to convince you that these are not the future of desktop Linux apps.

Recently, I’ve been using my own custom CSS reset. It includes all of the little tricks I’ve discovered to improve both the user experience and the CSS authoring experience.
Like other CSS resets, it’s unopinionated when it comes to design / cosmetics. You can use this reset for any project, no matter the aesthetic you’re going for.
In this tutorial, we’ll go on a tour of my custom CSS reset. We’ll dig into each rule, and you’ll learn what it does and why you might want to use it!
It has 9 rules and unlike previous resets, the goal is not to create a ‘blank slate’ that is uniform across browsers. Josh walks/talks you through each rule and why they made the cut.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eric Bailey’s take on CSS is certainly counter to the direction most are headed:
Human-friendly CSS is an interface that prioritizes people. It allows someone using your website or web app to easily make modifications to get what they need. This is huge because we can’t know who the person is, or what circumstances they’re experiencing.
Humans reading/modifying your CSS may seem like an edge case, but it’s more common than you think:
Stylus on the Chrome Web Store has more than half a million users. Stylish has over three million. That’s a lot of people modifying the web to get what they want.
He goes on to point out that even if it weren’t that many people, it’s still worth considering for other reasons. Lots to ponder.

Remix is a seamless server and browser runtime that provides snappy page loads and instant transitions by leveraging distributed systems and native browser features instead of clunky static builds. Built on the Web Fetch API (instead of Node) it can run anywhere. It already runs natively on Cloudflare Workers, and of course supports serverless and traditional Node.js environments, so you can come as you are.
Okay that is pretty sales-y (hit up the homepage for more like that), so you might prefer jumping straight over to the docs instead and check out the example Jokes app to see what’s what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doug Turnbull breaks down a major difference between two beloved programming languages in how they handle iteration.
Python embraces for. Objects tell for how to work with them, and the for loop’s body processes what’s given back by the object. Ruby does the opposite. In Ruby, for itself (via each) is a method of the Object. The caller passes the body of the for loop to this method.
He goes on to give examples and explain why each approach might map to different developers’ brains… differently. Here’s a succinct summary, if you don’t have time for the deeper discussion:
In Ruby, the objects control the affordances. In Python, the language does.

Upload capacity: 14.696 Mbps
Download capacity: 21.661 Mbps
Upload flows: 20
Download flows: 12
Responsiveness: Low (103 RPM)

What’s interesting about it is that it measures your upload and download in parallel by default, which is more aligned with real-world usage than running them back-to-back like other tests do.

grep -v "jog" ~/.zsh_history_ext | grep -a --color=never "${PWD}   " | cut -f1 -d"|" | tail

It’s possibly the best advice for managers I’ve given so far. When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!
I have to remind myself of this when I’m rushing. It’s faster to ping someone to arrange a synchronous talk than it is to write out what I need to say and cover all the bases. But that doesn’t give me license to skip all the context. Broad strokes are okay. An information vacuum is not okay.
Hmm I probably have to work on this one…

Ruby is awesome. We love its readability, flexibility, and developer-centric nature. Still, here at Mars, we also love Go because it has its own sense of simplicity and magic, too. Simply put, Go holds advantages over Ruby in some aspects: it’s faster, statically typed, and comes with cool concurrency primitives out of the box. This being said, some intrepid readers might find themselves grappling with a seemingly reasonable question: if Go is so darn good, why don’t we just write everything with it?

In recent years, continuous fuzzing has become an essential part of the software development lifecycle. By feeding unexpected or random data into a program, fuzzing catches bugs that would otherwise slip through the most thorough manual checks and provides coverage that would take staggering human effort to replicate. NIST’s guidelines for software verification, recently released in response to the White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, specify fuzzing among the minimum standard requirements for code verification.
Today, we are excited to announce ClusterFuzzLite, a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before. With just a few line…]]></summary>

For years now, blogs, webinars and white papers have opined that GitOps is the Next Big Thing, yet here a respected voice in the field is saying to tread carefully. So what gives? Do we need to pump the brakes? Is GitOps just a lot of unwarranted hype? Or is there a missing piece of the puzzle here? As in so many things, the answer is: It’s complicated. GitOps can be transformative for some teams, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avdi Grimm kicks off a new series of posts (that I’m quite excited about) on the various parts that go into a “banana stand” business by deftly wielding a classic Arrested Development gag and telling the tale of how he got his stand started:
I’m a software developer by trade. I’ve slung code either as an employee or as an independent consultant for over two decades. But around ten years ago, I started selling e-books about programming. At the time it was a way to recoup the time and energy I had sunk into researching conference talks, as well as a way to expand on the topics of those talks.
E-books expanded to screencasts, and then to courses. I found myself with a diversified product income that sometimes rivaled or even exceeded what I could expect from a developer’s salary.
As a result, gaps between gigs haven’t felt like “unemployment” for a long time. Instead, they are opportunities to work on my education business. Recently, a major gig I’d been looking forward to fell through at the last second. Once I worked through the disappointment, I was like: “welp, there’s always money in the banana stand!”
The first component of your banana stand: a mailing list

        <updated>2021-11-09T15:15:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a great post byu Andy Kimball on what they mean when they say CockroachDB is now serverless:
Serverless means you don’t have to think about servers. Of course there are servers hard at work handling your application’s requests, but that’s our problem, not yours. We do all the hard work behind the scenes of allocating, configuring, and maintaining the servers. Instead of paying for servers, you pay for the requests that your application makes to the database and the storage that your data consumes.
How they got here:
Before now, a single physical CockroachDB cluster was intended for dedicated use by a single user or organization. That is called single-tenancy. Over the past several CockroachDB releases, we’ve quietly been adding multi-tenancy support…
How they scale it:
Within every Serverless cluster, there is an autoscaler component that is responsible for determining the ideal number of SQL pods that should be assigned to each tenant, whether that be one, many, or zero.
And what it all means for Cockroach’s users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rachel by the Bay:
There’s a post going around tonight about how someone forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full table scans (or something like that). The rub is that instead of just being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy vendor system charged by the row or somesuch. So, by scanning the whole table, they touched all of those rows, and oh hey, massive amounts of money just set ablaze!
The usual venues are discussing it, and I get the impression some people have the wrong approach to this. I want to describe a truly bad database schema I encountered, and then tell you a little about what it did to the system performance.
A fun story with an excellent twist at the end.

One of mine around coding goes back to college in the 70s. I learned about parsing arithmetic expressions and putting them into Reverse Polish notation. And then, I figured out that, just like multiplication is repeated addition, division is repeated subtraction.
