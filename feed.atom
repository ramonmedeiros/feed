They note the rapid rise of open models, and speculate that just as in open source software, open models will dominate the future.  Such rapid advancement creates its own problems though, so they finish by itemizing concerns such as cybersecurity, workflow productivity, and impact on human culture.

In February, we expanded Google Workspace client-side encryption (CSE) capabilities to include Gmail and Calendar in addition to Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet.
CSE in Gmail was designed to provide commercial and public sector organizations an additional layer of confidentiality and data integrity protection beyond the existing encryption offered by default in Workspace. When CSE is enabled, email messages are protected using encryption keys that are fully under the customer’s control. The data is encrypted on the client device before it’s sent to Google servers that do not have access to the encryption keys, which means the data is indecipherable to us–we have no tec…]]></summary>

As someone working a lot with serverless to create large scale systems, for me the complexity in Kubernetes doesn’t seem worth it, especially when onboarding new people. But I’d like to see it from the other perspectives. I could be missing something.”
So we invited Joe on the show alongside Abdel Sghiouar and Srdjan Petrovic to discuss!

“Secure your dependencies”—it’s the new supply chain mantra.

Our previous installment of the Supply chain security for Go series shared the ecosystem tools available to Go developers to manage their dependencies and vulnerabilities. This second installment describes the ways that Go helps you trust the integrity of a Go package. 










Go has built-in protections against three major ways packages can be compromised before reaching you:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a fancified excerpt of Jonathan Norris’ unpopular opinion on Go Time #275. Jonathan is Co-Founder & CTO @ DevCycle where they’re using WebAssembly in very interesting ways. To get the full experience you should listen while you read.
🎧  Click here to listen along while you read. It's better!   🎧
The advantages of WebAssembly, with its:
tight security model
very fast boot-up time
scalability at the edge
much smaller footprints
portability across environments
will really drive a shift away from container-based runtimes for things Kubernetes and edge workloads by 2030. There’s a ton of energy around making this happen within the WebAssembly community.

Finally, they talk through the risk and compliance implications of generative AI, which was in the news this week in the EU.

Visibility into Extensions being used in your environment


Having visibility into what and how extensions are being used enables IT and security teams to assess potential security implications, ensure compliance with organizational policies, and mitigate potential risks. There are three ways you can get critical information about extensions in your organization:
1. App and extension usage reporting
Organizations can gain visibility into every Chrome extension that is installed across an enterprise’s fleet in Chrome App and Extension Usage Reporting.
