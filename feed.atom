In our last two posts (1,2) we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to SLSA and covered the basics and details of how they’d use SLSA for their organizations. Today we’ll close out the series by exploring how each organization pulls together the various solutions into a heterogeneous supply chain. 
As a reminder, Acme is trying to produce a container image that contains three artifacts:

The Squirrel package ‘foo’
The Oppy package ‘baz’
A custom executable, ‘bar’, written by Acme employees.
The process starts with ‘foo’ package authors triggering a build using GitHub Actions. This results in a new version of ‘foo’ (an artifact with hash ‘abc’) being pushed to the Squirrel repo along with its SLSA proven…]]></summary>

Hundreds of companies have no access to JIRA, Confluence and OpsGenie. What can engineering teams learn from the poor handling of this outage?
The TL;DR on the cause of the outage is a script that was supposed to “mark for deletion” some records also had “permanently delete” functionality and was run against a wrong list of IDs, improperly deleting 400 of their customers. Oh, and their backup restore process is really good at doing all customers, but not a subset. Ruh roh!
Lots to learn here, and Gergely puts a fine point on the biggest takeaways. A must-read!

DNS is simple enough that you can grok it quickly, but still complex enough that Adam learned a ton along the way: reading RFCs, network sockets, Bitvec, and more.

Today we’ll cover the details: where to store attestations and policies, what policies should check, and how to handle key distribution and trust.

Attestation storage
Attestations play a large role in SLSA and it’s essential that consumers of artifacts know where to find the attestations for those artifacts.

Co-located in repo

Attestations could be colocated in the repository that hosts the artifact. This is how Squirrel plans to store attestations for packages. They even want to add support to the Squirrel CLI (e.g. acorn get-attestations foo@1.2.3).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this episode we talk about launching Dagger with all four founders: Andrea, Eric, Sam & Solomon.
While you may remember Sam & Solomon from episode 23, this time we assembled all four superheroes in this story and went deeper, covering nearly three years of refinements, the launch, as well as the world-class team & community that is coming together to solve the next problem of shipping software. Container images and Kubernetes are great steps in the right direction, but now it’s time for the next leap into the future.
You can use Dagger to run your CI/CD pipelines locally, without needing to commit and push. You can also use Dagger as a Makefile alternative, which resonates with Gerhard, but go further and your perspective on documentation & automation may start shifting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On our episode with Brian Kernighan, I asked him if there were ever a situation in which he would advise you start a new program in C today. His response:
I think probably unless you are in one of these resource-constrained environments, clearly, right upfront, that you’re going to be resource-constrained and the improvement of hardware isn’t gonna rescue you in the next couple of years, I would not start with C. I really wouldn’t. And then it depends what is your application.
As if on queue, StackOverflow blogger Marcin Pasinski has done a comparison between C and Go in the quintessential resource-constrained environment. Oddly enough, no mention of TinyGo in the piece, but otherwise a solid analysis.

One of the great benefits of SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is its flexibility. As an open source framework designed to improve the integrity of software packages and infrastructure, it is as applicable to small open source projects as to enterprise organizations. But with this flexibility can come a bewildering array of options for beginners—much like salsa dancing, someone just starting out might be left on the dance floor wondering how and where to jump in.
Though it’s tempting to try to establish a single standard for how to use SLSA, it’s not possible: SLSA is not a line dance where everyone does the same moves, at the same time, to the same song. It’s a varied system with different styles, moves, and flourishe…]]></summary>

I have been a big fan of the write libraries, not frameworks argument for a while now. Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.
I don’t disagree!
The challenge with principles & patterns is they are more difficult to formalize (and communicate) than libraries & frameworks because they’re by nature less specific and more meta (lowercase “m” ftw).
In other words, libraries & frameworks are an end product. Principles & patterns are means to an end. It’s easier to ship a product than to ship the means to it.
The latter is the realm of documentation, education, and conversation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dan Luu:
Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.
Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero how one might build out a simple monolith… Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith.
He goes on to describe boring choices they’ve made and  counter-balances that some by also describing why they’ve made some more complex choices such as GraphQL and Kubernetes. An excellent, nuanced piece.

I remember getting this game for Christmas and playing it nearly non-stop until school started again after the new year. Greatest entry in the franchise? Easily!

My foremost exposure to the practice came from Jeremy Ashkenas’ CoffeeScript and Backbone.js docs. I always found it cool and useful to read, but couldn’t imagine myself writing code/docs that way. Which brings us to this bit at the end of the article:
“One of the things we learned is that it’s very expensive,” he said. “And so you spend time trying to figure out what sort of situations justify the expense. And one of them is where people are building relatively small, sophisticated kernels that are going to be shared widely.”
Seems like Jeremy’s use case drilled it. If you’re mostly writing application code, literate programming probably isn’t worth the headache, but for library/framework authors…

Many of the recent high-profile software attacks that have alarmed open-source users globally were consequences of supply chain integrity vulnerabilities: attackers gained control of a build server to use malicious source files, inject malicious artifacts into a compromised build platform, and bypass trusted builders to upload malicious artifacts. 
Each of these attacks could have been prevented if there were a way to detect that the delivered artifacts diverged from the expected origin of the software. But until now, generating verifiable information that described where, when, and how software artifacts were produced (information known as provenance) was difficult. This information allows users to trace artif…]]></summary>

The next Google can’t just be an input box that spits out links. We need new thinking to create something much better than what came before.
In the last few years, different groups of people came to the same conclusion, and started working on the next generation of search engines.
For this new generation, privacy is necessary, and invasive ads are not an option. But that’s where the commonalities end. Beyond that, they’ve all taken the idea of a search engine in very different directions.
The post goes on to describe & detail a whole new wave of search engines. I had no idea so many people were working on this problem. Exciting!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Squeaky team goes from dev straight to prod (same here), but many people advocate for (and use) staging or other “pre-live” environments instead.
While there are obvious benefits to deploying to different environments, at Squeaky we’ve decided to take a different approach. We only have two environments: our laptops, and production. Once we merge into the main branch, it will be immediately deployed to production.
Perhaps that sounds unusual, but so far it’s outweighed the benefits of pre-live environments, and we believe it’s helping us to ship faster, and lower the number of issues on production. So, I thought I’d write this post to share why we think it works, and why you should consider it too.

        <updated>2022-04-01T16:40:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot off the press from our friend Ben Johnson:
Postlite is a network proxy to allow access to remote SQLite databases over the Postgres wire protocol. This allows GUI tools to be used on remote SQLite databases which can make administration easier.
The proxy works by translating Postgres frontend wire messages into SQLite transactions and converting results back into Postgres response wire messages. Many Postgres clients also inspect the pg_catalog to determine system information so Postlite mirrors this catalog by using an attached in-memory database with virtual tables. The proxy also performs minor rewriting on these system queries to convert them to usable SQLite syntax.
It appears that Ben is taking code contributions this time around, but only for bug & documentation fixes.

It started as all good projects do … with Rick Astley.
After seeing the project about how to Rickroll your friends with Grafana — in which a seemingly innocent hyperlink surprises users with the music video for Astley’s classic “Never Gonna Give You Up” rendered with Prometheus and Grafana — a question arose: Can Grafana run Doom?
Thankfully, this post breaks Betteridge’s law of headlines. The answer to the question is a resounding yes!

Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out” time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
In addition to the author’s suggested solution to this problem allow me to add: developer retention! Nobody has more to figure out in a system than the people who just joined the team. Cut down on that (via better compensation, workplace satisfaction, etc.) and you cut way down on that oh so expensive “figuring out” time.

You would expect that a more standardized, all-around, full-proof solution is out there, but I am afraid there isn’t. It’s a complex matter and depending on what you are building, implementation varies.
You will probably start with a boolean admin flag in your User model and then you will replace it with a role field, as we all did. However, as things progress and the business model becomes more and more complex, so do the solutions that we need to implement in order to deal with that complexity.
But how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment? In the following post I hope to help you get there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Wikman reacts to Gerhard’s excellent conversation with Kelsey Hightower on Ship It!
So he essentially said, I’m interpreting here, that when it comes to deploying software to servers the documented manual steps for deploying something need to be the canonical reference. Then whether you build bash scripts, Ansible playbooks, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, Terraform, Kubernetes or something else to encode that procedure into something repeatable and scalable that’s a separate step. Having documented the process required to set it up means that there is an answer to the question: How do I get this running? An answer that doesn’t require you to parse the .yml files or grok Ansible roles and groups.
Lars springs forward from there with many thoughts of his own on the matter.

But I’ve found there isn’t actually a whole lot of information out there on exactly how to prevent bugs in the early stages of a software development project. i.e. before code is written, while requirements/user stories are being written or just after the requirements/user stories have been written.
Here I would like to share exactly how I help prevent bugs on projects and how I help others come up with ideas on how to prevent bugs as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a general belief that legacy systems, stale code, and archaic tooling are sleeping dogs – we avoid them fearing a collapse from interference or deprioritize them for seemingly more important projects. I think this strategy of intentional avoidance and/or deprioritization is perfect for disasters.
The challenge with systems that do not fail is that they have no fixes when they eventually fail. Thus, it is more urgent to fix these systems than is usually accepted.

Then there is also the case of OTT streaming platforms where the show you were going to watch over weekend has now disappeared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Where by “auditing” they mean change tracking, not security testing:
Auditing is particularly useful for historical analysis. To demonstrate, imagine you have a users table that tracks when a user is online. You might add a status column which can have one of two values: online and offline. How would you track how long a user is online for throughout an entire month? An auditing system would track every change with timestamps, and so you can measure the difference between each timestamp and sum them up for the entire month.
What really impresses me about the Supabase team is how much they’re leaning in to Postgres’ rich feature set to build high-quality-yet-low-level abstractions for their users. Paul Copplestone emphasized this when we had him on the show back in January.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Max Howell, creator of Homebrew, has gone back to his notes on brew2 to apply web3 concepts to help “distribute value to open source.” He’s calling this new brew tea.
Tools like Homebrew lie beneath all development tools, assisting developers to actually get development done. We know the graph of all open source, which means we’re uniquely placed to innovate in interesting and exciting ways. This is exactly what tea will do. We’re taking our knowledge of how to make development more efficient and throwing innovations nobody has ever really considered before.
With plans to move the package registry on-chain, Max lays out the numerous benefits due to “inherent benefits of blockchain technology”:
Packages will be immutable (no more left-pad incidents)
Packages will always be available (we’ll use decentralized storage)
Releases will be signed by the maintainers themselves (rather than a middleman you are told you can trust)
Tools can be built to fundamentally verify the integrity of your app’s open source constitution
Token can flow through the graph
Max says “token flowing is where things get really interesting,” and goes on to say “with our system people who care about the health of the open source ecosystem buy some token and stake it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Jon Maddox on The GitHub blog (from waaay back in the day):
At GitHub, we have normalized on a set of script names for all of our projects that individual contributors will be familiar with the second after they clone a project. We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.
Here’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:
script/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies
script/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time
script/update – updates a project to run at its current version
script/server – starts app
script/test – runs tests
script/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests
script/console – opens a console
Each of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.
Note: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.
