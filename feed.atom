        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yury Molodtsov:
Running your own blog in 2023 is still needlessly complicated, especially if you have any kind of taste. Why have one in the first place?
Social apps and networks are obviously the easiest options, but they’re geared toward vastly different things, and I just don’t trust their longevity. Having your own platform enables flexibility and portability, so your content can be kept online practically forever.
This!
There are many options out there, ranging from WordPress and Ghost to static blogs to managed online platforms and Micro.blog. How do you choose between them?
What follows is a survey of some of the popular tools and what Yury thinks about them. My advice is this: don’t worry too much about tooling. That’s the easy part. Writing’s the hard part. We often bike shed the easy parts to avoid the hard part. Yuri seems to agree:
Having the right tool certainly helps, but at the end of the day, what matters is what you write there. Focus more on the content and just ensure the process of writing and posting is simple enough.

Standard Ruby (a Ruby style guide with linter & automatic code fixer) now ships with its own built-in language server, which enables it to offer lightning-fast linting and formatting for supported editors. This new extension leverages that language server to deliver a much faster UX than most other Ruby extensions available for VS Code.
I don’t know how many of our readers live at the intersection of VS Code and Ruby… but if you do, this should be great news for you. 😉

A modern Android powered smartphone is a complex hardware device: Android OS runs on a multi-core CPU - also called an Application Processor (AP). And the AP is one of many such processors of a System On Chip (SoC). Other processors on the SoC perform various specialized tasks — such as security functions, image & video processing, and most importantly cellular communications. The processor performing cellular communications is often referred to as the baseband. For the purposes of this blog, we refer to the software that runs on all these other processors as “Firmware”.

The new headless Chrome has been released in November 2022. For the moment, it hasn’t become the standard headless mode. It’s still hidden behind a –headless=new flag. However, it will soon become the standard headless mode, and this is going to change a lot of things when it comes to bot detection, particularly detection based on browser fingerprint.
Antoine is the head of research at DataDome, a bot detection company, so he knows what he’s talking about here. The good news is you can still detect the new headless Chrome, but it will be more tricky. The other good news is that fingerprinting is just one of many tools in the bot detector’s belt. Others include request behavior, reputation scores, proxy detection & TLS fingerprinting.

lsof is powerful, but I use it infrequently and its CLI is inscrutable. That’s a perfect setup for a GUI like this.

GitHub supports adding HTML in Markdown, but it is pretty aggressive when removing HTML that can be potentially dangerous to users. Things like scripts, iframes, and similar will get removed or “silenced” to avoid malicious content from being served to users.
Luckily, there’s one way to sneak in some HTML (or a web page) inside the README. You can do it via SVG and foreignObject SVG element.

SQLite is one of those projects that I wish I had known about long before I did. I had heard about it, but for many years I never thought about taking a serious look at it because I was under the false impression that is was a tiny database only useful for personal address books and small embedded devices.
I highly recommend you take a look at SQLite!

The main reason why Gerhard is intrigued by Rust is the incredible resource frugality. Fewer CPUs means less energy used, which is good for the planet, and good for the monthly bill. This becomes most noticeable at Amazon’s scale, when S3, Lambda, CloudFront and other services start adding Rust components.

In this article, we want to show how knowledge of one of these languages can help you get up to speed with another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a post about overestimating our short-term ability and underestimate our long-term ability, Paavan drops this nugget:
It’s important to recognise the value of quantity over quality. This is best illustrated by an anecdote that I first heard from Kevin Cannon at PUSH Conference: a potter who spends time making 100 vases will end up with one that’s better quality than if they spent the same amount of time trying to just make 1 perfect vase. So, while quality is obviously important, focussing on quantity at the start of a creative journey is the way to get there.
I’ve never heard that anecdote before, but I absolutely love the truth it so clearly represents.

In this blog post, I’ll elucidate why backlogs exist and why they never shrink. Then, I’ll expound on why they’re useless and harmful. Finally, I’ll demonstrate how one can work without a backlog and explain why it’s much more productive to do so.
I agree whole heartedly with his “why they never shrink” logic, but I’m not willing to say that makes them “useless and harmful.” I’m not sure Lucas even believes that, since his advice of what to do instead at the end of the post boils down to “keep a short backlog.”
Still, I enjoy Lucas’s thought process and you might too. Recommended reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This short piece by Jim Nielsen resonated with me (much like Manu’s post resonated with Jim). He says:
I like this idea of beginning to notice and bring attention to people or creative works that intentionally bring closure, even when you’re left wanting a little more.
When it comes to open source software, people often see a lack of activity and proclaim that a project is unmaintained. Sometimes that’s true, but sometimes the project is merely finished, and that’s okay. In fact, it’s better than okay. It’s downright successful.
There’s a big difference between quitting and finishing. Quitting is in the realm of failure, but finishing is in the realm of success. The key is to define what finished means before you get there, lest you feel like you’re merely quitting.
The art of knowing when to quit? Sure. But how about the art of knowing how to finish?

StreetPass is a browser extension that helps you find your people on Mastodon. It piggybacks off the way Mastodon handles decentralized identity verification and turns it into a simple discovery tool that recommends users based on the websites you visit! Available for Chrome and Firefox (soon Safari).
Discovery is one of the more challenging facets of federated social networking. It gets even more challenging now that Twitter’s API is getting paywall’d, so most of the free tools to port your Twitter social graph over to Mastodon will quit working. I expect more tools like StreetPass to pop up in the coming days as the Fediverse seems to be capturing that hacker spirit Twitter once embraced.

In the past 10 years, the median size for a desktop webpage has gone from 468 KB to 2284 KB, a 388.3% increase. For mobile, this jump is even more staggering — 145 KB to 2010 KB — a whopping 1288.1% increase.
That’s a lot of weight to ship over a network, especially for mobile. As a result, users experience terrible UX, slow loading times, and a lack of interactivity until everything is rendered. But all that code is necessary to make our sites work the way we want.
This is the problem with being a frontend dev today. What started out fun for frontend developers, building shit-hot sites with all the bells and whistles, has kinda turned into not fun. We’re now fighting different browsers to support, slow networks to ship code over, and intermittent, mobile connections. Supporting all these permutations is a giant headache.
How do we square this circle? By heading back to the server (Swiss basement not required).
He goes on to talk about isomorphic JavaScript frameworks and Deno’s offerings in this space. But hey, you don’t need all that fancy stuff to do SSR. All you need is a programming language that can render HTML (this is almost all languages) and a server…

Last May I left my job on the Go team at Google to experiment with more sustainable paths for open-source maintainers. I held on to my various maintainer hats (Go cryptography, transparency tooling, age, mkcert, yubikey-agent…), iterated on the model since September, and I’m happy to report that I am now a full-time independent open-source maintainer.
People like Filippo are still (unfortunately) the exception, not the rule. BUT! I’ll celebrate every time an open source maintainer makes it to the promised land, hopefully paving the way for others to follow after.
I’m sharing details about my progress to hopefully popularize the model, and eventually help other maintainers adopt it, although I’m not quite ready to recommend anyone else drop everything to try this just yet.

Since launching in 2016, Google's free OSS-Fuzz code testing service has helped get over 8800 vulnerabilities and 28,000 bugs fixed across 850 projects. Today, we’re happy to announce an expansion of our OSS-Fuzz Rewards Program, plus new features in OSS-Fuzz and our involvement in supporting academic fuzzing research. 
Refreshed OSS-Fuzz rewards 
  
The OSS-Fuzz project's purpose is to support the open source community in adopting fuzz testing, or fuzzing — an automated code testing technique for uncovering bugs in software. In addition to the OSS-Fuzz service, which provides a free platform for continuous fuzzing to critical open source projects, we established an OSS-Fuzz Reward Program in 2017 as part of our wider Patch Rewards Program.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Richard MacManus from The New Stack spoke with Netlify CEO Matt Biilmann about the deal and their new catchphrase: “composable architectures”
Biilmann described it as a “change away from monolithic solutions,” citing a couple of examples: Adobe Experience Manager “as the DXP [digital experience platform] system for all your web productions” and Drupal “as the core engine that both powers the backend and the frontend of your site, the business logic and the UI layer, and so on.” He argues that these types of “monolithic” solutions can “start to feel very legacy and very dated.”
I’m not sure if “composable architectures” will stick, but they sure did a good job of making “jamstack” a thing, so time will tell on that.

The theory goes that if you ship code on Friday you’ll inevitably be working Saturday to fix what you broke. This makes logical sense; software is messy and mistakes are unavoidable.
But no, shipping code on Friday isn’t bad. At least, it doesn’t have to be.
The key to their success is confidence, which comes from having a solid deployment pipeline and shipping through it often. Gerhard Lazu hit that nail on the head in this short clip as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bryan Braun reflects on years of pairing:
I’ve pair-programmed in a lot of different situations. I’ve been the junior developer who needed to be unblocked. I’ve been the new team member, being onboarded to a new codebase. I’ve paired with peers for knowledge-sharing and productivity. And I’ve been the senior dev.
He goes on to say that it’s easy to put a pairing session on rails to avoid embarrassment, but:
When I think back, my favorite pair-programming sessions were the one where things went wrong. These were the moments that taught me what being a programmer is all about. What do you do when you don’t know what to do? How do you break down a new problem? What tools do you reach for? When do you abandon your current approach? These are things you can’t learn from a blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robin Linacre:
SQL should be the first option considered for new data engineering work. It’s robust, fast, future-proof and testable. With a bit of care, it’s clear and readable. A new SQL engine - DuckDB - makes SQL competitive with other high performance dataframe libraries, making SQL a good candidate for data of all sizes.
You can make a similar argument for SQL that Gary Bernhardt made for Vim. Here’s Gary on Vim, run your own s/Vim/SQL/g filter on this as you read it:
…just for me, 15 years; at the beginning of that time, TextMate was just becoming popular. Then it was Sublime Text was cool. Then Atom was cool. Then VS Code was cool. A lot of people switched between two of those, three of those, maybe all four of those, and that whole time I was just getting better and better and better at Vim… And you multiply that out by the length of a career, you use Vim for 40 years - you’re gonna be so good at it by the end, and it’s still gonna be totally relevant, I think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love a good “I built a thing and here is how I built that thing” post, especially when it’s penned by someone like Chris who’s sure to keep you entertained along the way.
Wouldn’t it be neat to have aggregated data (for a website, daily email, push alert, etc) of kids events in our surrounding area so we know about them right away?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chip Huyen:
When we actively hire, our startup gets 150 - 200 applications each month. I read every single one of them. Sometimes, I’d talk to a candidate and see that what we perceived as their strongest aspects actually weren’t included in their resume. Occasionally, a candidate would tell me that they didn’t expect their resume to still be screened by humans – had they known, they would have written their resume differently.
The resume evaluation process is pretty much a black box for most candidates. And it is so because few hiring managers have publicly discussed this. I thought I should start the conversation.
Chip’s team mostly hires for infra and ML roles, so some of the advice here will be catered towards those positions. Still, if you’re on the job market you’d be well-served by spending 15-20 minutes reading this post and tweaking your resume where applicable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last September, at the 🇨🇭 Swiss Cloud Native Day, Florian Forster, co-founder & CEO of ZITADEL, talked about why they switched to serverless containers. ZITADEL has a really interesting workload that is both CPU intensive and latency sensitive. On top of this, their users are global, and traffic is bursty. Florian talks about how they evaluated AWS, GCP & Azure before they settled on the platform that met their requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently working at a top tier investment bank as a software engineer. I’m an insignificant cog in a machine that skims the cream from the milk. I’m earning the most money I’ve ever made and yet I’m the least fulfilled I’ve ever been.
Right now in the UK and across the world, things are uncertain. Companies are laying workers off, there’s a cost of living and energy crisis. I’m excruciatingly lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to develop the skillset I’ve got. In times like these every signal is telling me to stay on the path I’m on, enjoying the comfort and safety of a high paying job.
I’m not going to listen. I’m quitting and I’m leaving this place. I’ll see you in the mountains.
After this post blew up, Seán wrote a follow-up on what quitting the rat race means to him.
