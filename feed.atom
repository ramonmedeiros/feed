Google is committed to enhancing the security of open-source technologies, especially those that make up the foundation for many of our products, like Linux and KVM. To this end we are excited to announce the launch of kvmCTF, a vulnerability reward program (VRP) for the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor first announced in October 2023.





KVM is a robust hypervisor with over 15 years of open-source development and is widely used throughout the consumer and enterprise landscape, including platforms such as Android and Google Cloud. Google is an active contributor to the project and we designed kvmCTF as a collaborative way to help identify & remediate vulnerabilities and further harden this fundamental security boundary.
