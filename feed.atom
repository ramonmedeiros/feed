It minimizes the boilerplate for web service business logic. It shares concepts with the browser and reduces the concepts that the programmer needs to know.
People like Ryan and his colleagues at Deno are exploring this future, but it‚Äôs not quite here yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had the honor of joining Robby Russell (who you may remember from Oh My Zsh) on his Maintainable podcast for a super-fun discussion on well-maintained software. Here‚Äôs how Robby describes it:
Robby has a chat with Jerod Santo, the Managing Editor and Partner of Changelog Media. Jerod helps lead and co-host Changelog‚Äôs flagship podcast, The Changelog, and builds all the cool stuff that makes Changelog awesome. Jerod shares his journey from being a typical networking engineer (Infosec) to the experienced programmer that he is today and his programming wisdom from the trenches.
Tune in as he highlights the undeniable importance of automated test suites and code readability, describes the arc of an engineer‚Äôs career, and talks about the past experiences that make him lean more towards clarity over cleverness when coding. He also shares some of the things engineers should consider in regard to pulling in third-party code or writing from scratch, and so much more. Enjoy!
Thanks for having me, Robby! üíö

Here‚Äôs what it comes down to: teams perform well when successes are shared and failures are owned‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt celebrate successes enough, and part of that (I think) is caused by the feeling of pressure that comes from working on a project that seems dooomed to fail without meticulous and ever-present attention.
He goes on to delve in to the source(s) of engineering failures, the dangers of ‚Äúbrightsizing‚Äù, known predictors for project success, and a bunch of related topics. Lots to ponder here alongside James, who‚Äôs seen a lot of software projects live & die during his eight years in the business.

Framework has created a really slick, fully user serviceable, laptop and have recently started selling the mainboard as a SBC for general use.

When they reached out and explained their plans and offered to let me play with one, I jumped at the chance and this is what I came up with after some experimentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love when software engineers share their career/life choices and the reasoning behind them so others can benefit from their perspective, like this one on bucket filling:
Somebody once described balance to me as three buckets filled with water. One for career, a second for physical health, and a third for social and family life. At any point, one bucket might be running low. But as long as the overall water level is high enough, things should be fine.
Scott‚Äôs choice to join a startup seems odd given his reason for leaving Google, but:
So: am I happier? Undoubtedly yes.
I work more hours. I‚Äôm more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now. But what I do makes a difference that I can see. Progress feels 10x faster.
Most surprising is that I have more energy. It‚Äôs easier to find motivation to get back in the gym. I have more energy in social situations.
Working more hours sounds like tipping the work/life balance in the wrong direction, but excitement about your work certainly changes the calculus. He‚Äôs happier now, so that‚Äôs great!

For loyal listeners you know we‚Äôve had Sid on this show before, so of course we had to get him back on the show post-IPO to get all the details of this new journey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‚Äôve long been fascinated by literate programming (the art of writing code as if it was a novel), but it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve seen a good example of in practice. Here‚Äôs a good one:
I wanted to showcase the BDD-inspired low-tech solution I came up with via a toy project, demonstrating a small but significant programming task, broken down as series of design-implementation cycles.
Wordle is a perfect target: it‚Äôs a small codebase, with a half dozen features to string together into a useable game.
This story has five chapters and a satisfying conclusion:
This project was my first foray into literate programming at this scale, an attempt to bring together all the good ideas of TDD, modern Python development, Gherkin usage for requirements traceability purposes (without overly zealous extremes of Cucumber automation). All these ideas were until now scattered, implemented each without the others in different places, and this project fuses them into something I hope is more valuable than the sum of its parts.

Basic premise is: browsers are great at navigating pages, let‚Äôs leverage that by serving users directly with HTML. This already gives you half-decent pages but you can go further and sprinkle on some sugar. A bit of JS. Instead of reinventing the world in JS let‚Äôs try to really use what modern browsers provide natively and then push just a bit forward.
Is the pendulum starting to swing away from SPAs/client-side rendering and back toward MPAs/server-side rendering? Will we ever find balance somewhere in the middle?

This is a big step in the right direction and their new(ish) 2FA for GitHub Mobile feature helps make the burden not as cumbersome as it might be otherwise.

In the interest of holding our new platform right, we thought that it would be a great idea to talk to someone that does this all day, every day, for many years now.
We touch up on how to run database migrations safely, and how to upgrade our application config to the latest Phoenix version. We also talked about some of the more advanced platform features that we may want to start leveraging, like the multi-region PostgreSQL.

Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The second jq alternative we‚Äôve discovered this week! (first here)
jq is hard to use. There are alternatives like fq and zq, but they still make you learn a new programming language. Im tired of learning new programming languages.
gq is not optimized for speed, flexibility or beauty. gq is optimized for minimal learning/quick usage. gq understands that you don‚Äôt use it constantly, you use it once a month and then forget about it. So when you come back to it, gq will be easy to relearn. Just use the builtin library just like you would any other go project and you‚Äôre done. No unfamiliar syntax or operations, or surprising limits. Thats it.
I don‚Äôt know if Go is a great fit for this use-case, but if you already know it well‚Ä¶ makes sense.

Back in 2019, I started collecting all kinds of metrics about my life. Every single day for the last 2.5 years I tracked over 100 different data types - ranging from fitness & nutrition to social life, computer usage and weather.
This data produces 44 graphs that are all shared publicly on the website.

After migrating all our media files to AWS S3 (check episode 40), we thought that this part was going to be easy. Plan met reality. Pull request 407 has all the details.
We want to emphasise the type of partner relationships that we seek at Changelog & why they are important to us, as well as to our listeners. Honeycomb & Fly embody the principles that we care about, and Gerhard thinks that we are currently missing a Kubernetes partner.

Providing a safe experience to billions of users continues to be one of the highest priorities for Google Play.

In addition, Google Play Protect continues to scan billions of installed apps each day across billions of devices to keep people safe from malware and unwanted software.

We will cover zq‚Äôs performance in a future article, but to cut to the chase here, zq is almost always at least a bit faster than jq when processing JSON inputs
Almost always at least a bit faster is not something you‚Äôre likely to notice in practice.

I know you‚Äôre going to be tempted to reply with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre using it wrong‚Äù - but I‚Äôm not. This is how I like to use my computer. And it is clear that the MacBook isn‚Äôt my computer - it is Apple‚Äôs. (OK, OK! It belongs to my employer!)
Some of his grievances like window snapping and moving/removing UI elements can be alleviated with 3rd-party solutions, but he‚Äôs not wrong that the operating system doesn‚Äôt provide these features.
