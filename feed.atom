        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why create another form library? Here’s what Fomir’s author says to that:
I have tried many form libraries, like redux-form, formik, final-form, react-hook-form… None of them suit my taste. I would expect a forms library with these features:
Using schema
Easy to update form state
High Performance
More abstract
Fomir create form by passing a form schema which is a JSON tree. the form schema is very flexible, you can create any form by the schema.
I could see this as especially useful for form builders and similar tools where you’re providing a graphical way to build forms because your backend would just have to emit the correct JSON and let Fomir take it from there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Douglas Vaghetti:
It is a good time to be in tech right now: soaring salaries, daily LinkedIn recruiter spam, people bootcamping their way into career switches to tech, remote work allowing you to work for a major tech company making triple digit salaries from the beach. It really feels like every single company is trying to recruit programmers nowadays, and doing whatever they can to get them.
I’m certainly happy with the current state of affairs, but I can’t help but wonder: How does it end?
Will supply go up via a mass influx of people switching careers? Will demand go down via AI and newly created no-code/low-code alternatives? Time will tell. But for now, some food for thought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jujutsu (jj at your CLI) combines features from popular distributed version controls systems (Git, Mercurial, Darcs) with features not found in any of them, such as:
working-copy-as-commit
undo functionality
automatic rebase
safe replication via rsync/Dropbox/etc
And since it’s Git-compatible, adoption should be a breeze.
Jujutsu has two backends. One of them is a Git backend (the other is a native one). This lets you use Jujutsu as an alternative interface to Git. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits. You can always switch back to Git.
I’ve often wondered what will come next after Git. I’m not saying this is that thing, but it’s cool to see people working on the problem.

If you want to keep ’em separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at your API designs in certain ways.
These are my reactions to some of the ways a value can be returned (or not).

No obligation; just checking in to see what my availability is. Quickly thinking it over – I didn’t have any plans tonight, nothing in particular on my agenda. Why not? If I can help then someone else on the team won’t have to, and I don’t have anything better to do tonight.
The game is afoot. It might be a long night…

The self-documentation aspects are huge – being able to step into an unfamiliar function and know the shape of the objects it’s expecting is a massive boon when working on a large project. The added tooling features, with IntelliSense and its ilk, are also a big help for productivity. But to me, the most important reason to use a strongly typed system is to eliminate an entire class of runtime bugs, where a function gets passed an object it doesn’t know how to handle and fails at runtime.
It’s that last reason that leads to the purpose for this post. I recently handled a bug where a React component was throwing an exception at runtime. The source of the issue was a recent refactor done when internationalizing this area of our ap…]]></summary>

Relative to the Pandemic, the single biggest work question I’ve been asking myself for two years is: what did we lose? What is the measurable and objective loss for teams not working in close proximity? I’ve been looking for cracks. I’ve been looking for leading indicators of future doom. The Great Resignation seems like a proper crack, right? But are people quitting their jobs because they can’t work together or because their current job sucks and all this terror in the air has given them a new appreciation of what really matters?
A sobering perspective.

My excitement comes from what happened with GraphQL, where the release of servers, clients, and tools adhering to a common specification has produced a rich ecosystem; and from my own development of a plugin that could support new features through the protocol.
Don’t fret if you’re new to this “Block Protocol” concept, like myself: Leonardo starts off this (long) article with a nice explainer before he gets into the potential outcomes of WordPress’s involvement.

One might think that sudo is actually some binary deeply integrated into the kernel, relying on a special purpose-built system call to achieve its functionality. After all, it lets you use root without even providing the password for that account! But thanks to one bit inside file permissions, sudo can exist without any of this.

Until December 31 2022 we will pay 20,000 to 91,337 USD for exploits of vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, GKE or kCTF that are exploitable on our test lab.
We launched an expansion of kCTF VRP on November 1, 2021 in which we paid 31,337 to 50,337 USD to those that are able to compromise our kCTF cluster and obtain a flag. We increased our rewards because we recognized that in order to attract the attention of the community we needed to match our rewards to their expectations. We consider the expansion to have been a success, and because of that we would like to extend it even further to at least until the end of the year (2022).

First released on August 12, 1981, MS-DOS became the foundation for business computing for almost two decades. MS-DOS stood for Microsoft Disk Operating System and was often referred to simply as “DOS”. It is the software that helped build Microsoft, becoming the foundation Microsoft built the Windows operating system on. It went through 8 (and a half-ish) major revisions, with the final version being shipped with Windows ME in September, 2000.

Why should Titan exist? In Joe’s words, “Wall Street ignores everyday investors, and caters only to the ultra wealthy. This divide doesn’t sit well with us. So, we built Titan.” On today’s show Joe shares the journey, the why’s, the how’s, and the sequencing it might take to get to a $1 trillion of assets managed.

Fabled works with startups primarily, and after 26 years, Robin has a few interesting insights to share. What do you think, are haunted codebases real? At what point do pull requests become harmful? What about k3s running on KVM as a simple starting point for production? If this reminds you of #7, and the follow-up YouTube stream with Lars, it’s no coincidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.
It has an S3-compatible API and can be used as a storage backend for things like NextCloud, Matrix, and Mastodon. It’s being built by a non-profit in France that is “working to promote self-hosting and small-scale hosting.” Why do they do this?
self-hosting means running our own hardware at home, and providing 24/7 Internet services from there. We have many reasons for doing this. One is because this is the only way we can truly control who has access to our data. Another one is that it helps us be aware of the physical substrate of which the Internet is made: making the Internet run has an environmental cost which we want to evaluate and keep under control. The physical hardware also gives us a sense of community, calling to mind all of the people that could currently be connected and making use of our services, and reminding us of the purpose for which we are doing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This major undertaking was discussed by Matt Ahrens on our recent ZFS episode. How it works:
The feature reflows existing data, essentially rewriting it onto a new arrangement of disks – meaning the original group plus a newly added disk. In so doing, a new adjacent chunk of free space is created at the end of the logical RAID-Z group and thus at the end of each physical disk.
With a disclaimer:
While all capabilities of this feature have been implemented and all tests so far have been passed, there are still a few loose ends to tie up. Specifically, there is some code cleanup to do, some verbose logging to remove, some code documentation to write, and similar relatively minor tasks. We aim for this to be integrated by Q3.

There certainly are moments where I find myself on the settings page of a product because it failed to deliver the experience I really wanted. But not all settings are created equal.
There’s a difference between product settings that a product needs to get right by default and preferences that designers deliberately shouldn’t have a strong opinion on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conor O’Neill:
I blame my life-long work obsession with automation and avoiding repetitive drudgery on my first boss and mentor Danny in S3. He was horrified to see me doing the same thing over and over in a VAX code editor and introduced me to the magical world of macros.
From that point onwards, I was a man on a mission to save us all as much time as possible in our working days.
From Yahoo! Pipes to IFTTT to Node-RED and beyond: this is quite the journey.

Loops are the standard way to process collections like arrays and lists. However, some loops implement the same patterns repeatedly, leading to duplicate code. Higher-order functions—functions that use other functions as inputs or outputs—can reduce duplication by providing a simpler way to express common operations with collections.


Consider these two loops in JavaScript that decide if every object in an array meets a condition:


 
  
    
let everyRequestValid = true;
for (const request of requests) {
  if (!isValid(request)) {

Back in December Nora shared here thoughts in a Changelog post titled “Incident” shouldn’t be a four-letter word - which got a lot of attention from our readers. Today we’re talking with Nora about all things incidents — the learning and growth they represent for teams, why teams should focus on learning from incidents in the first place, their Howie guide to post‑incident investigations, why the next emerging role is an Incident Analyst, and she also shares a few book recommendations which we’ve linked up in the show notes.

--data [arg]
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--header "Accept: application/json"

Will more come of this? Time (and the community) will tell…
The discussion has been ignited in the curl community about what, if anything, we should do in curl to make it a smoother and better tool when working with JSON. The offered opinions range from nothing (“curl is content agnostic”) to full-fledged JSON generator, parser and pretty-printer (or a combination in between).

I have often been asked, “What is the most memorable bug that you have encountered in your testing career?” For me, it is hands down a bug that happened quite a few years ago.

Edward Tufte has this visual rule that 1+1=3. With a single line on the screen, you have just that single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‘object’ on the screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.
In UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’ created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap. This cognitive load is invisible and rarely discussed but it can be a real source of confusion.

We then simulate playing 1,000 Wordle games for each of these possible words, guessing based on the frequency of the word in the English language and the feedback received.
Then we take three measures to evaluate the observed distribution of ⬛🟨🟩 squares on Twitter according to our valid words.
The resulting code is included in the article.

While the tooling is impressive, it’s the principles behind it that captivated Gerhard’s imagination. Vincent has a rather interesting take on the monorepository idea, including one change - one version - one deploy. There are a lot of interesting links in the show notes, including all the code that Vincent uses to manage infrastructure.
As a result of this conversation, Gerhard is running Nix on one of his Macs, and also started experimenting with his first NixOS production instance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Old as in old school cool not old as in passe:
Despite the new gatekeepers’ best efforts, the old Internet never completely disappeared. Personal websites created by individuals that have always been the meat of the old Internet are still around. They are still about exploration, innovation, fun, and all the rest. Try as the new gatekeepers have, they simply have not had the power to eradicate the old Internet completely. All they can do is pretend it does not exist. And, that is exactly what they do.
But…
… the old Internet seems to be slowly and quietly coming back, and it is coming back even better than before. Now it has better technology and an additional well-defined purpose that it never had before.
Some people have begun to refer to personal websites as the “indie web”, the “small Internet”, or the “smol Internet”. Some seem to reserve the last two terms exclusively for the Gemini Network, which nearly quadrupled in size last year. But, I think all three terms should also apply to some of the other networks that use alternative networking protocols–the Gopher Network, the Tor network, and the ZeroNet network, to name a few.

Previously called PolicyKit, Polkit manages system-wide privileges in Unix-like OSes. It provides a mechanism for nonprivileged processes to safely interact with privileged processes. It also allows users to execute commands with high privileges by using a component called pkexec, followed by the command.
Oh my. It requires local access first, which is the only good news here.

        <id>changelog.com/news/13Qw</id>
        <link href="https://github.com/max-sixty/prql"/>
        <updated>2022-01-25T19:35:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRQL (pronounced “Prequel”) aims to be “a simpler and more powerful SQL”
Like SQL, it’s readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it transpiles to SQL.
To get an idea on PRQL’s design, they provide this SQL statement as an example:
SELECT TOP 20
    title,
    country,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
    AVG(salary + payroll_tax) AS average_gross_salary,
    SUM(salary + payroll_tax) AS sum_gross_salary,
    AVG(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
    SUM(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
WHERE salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost > 0 AND country = 'USA'
GROUP BY title, country
ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
HAVING count > 200

And then translate it to PRQL, which looks like:
from employees
filter country = "USA"                           # Each line transforms the previous result.
let gross_salary = salary + payroll_tax          # This _adds_ a column / variable.
let gross_cost   = gross_salary + benefits_cost  # Variables can use other variables.
filter gross_cost > 0
aggregate by:[title, country] [                  # `by` are the columns to group by.
    average salary,                              # These are the calcs to run on the groups.
    sum     salary,
    average gross_salary,
    sum     gross_salary,
    average gross_cost,
    sum     gross_cost,
    count,
]
sort sum_gross_cost                              # Uses the auto-generated column name.
filter count > 200
take 20

Supabase might be best known as “the open source Firebase alternative,” a tagline they might be reluctant to maintain. But from Adam’s perspective, he’s never been more excited about what they’re bringing to market for Postgres fans. In the last year, Supabase has gone from 0 to more than 80,000 databases on their platform — and they’re still in beta…and it’s open source. Hopefully today’s show sheds some light on why everyone is talking about Supabase.
