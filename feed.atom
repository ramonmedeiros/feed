        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today Gerhard shares the entire story behind his lost packets. He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider & ISP based in Sussex, UK.
Gerhard’s Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard’s DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections. And because nothing beats a real-world experiment, you can guess what is coming in this episode 😉
You will find latency & packet loss graphs, speed test…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any debugging story that includes the phrase, “My Mom’s verbal JIRA ticket was right” has a lot of promise. This one by Jim Nielsen delivers the goods. Here’s the culprit:
In my brain, I always thought of Safari and Chrome as “modern” browsers. But even Chrome, an “evergreen” browser, failed because it wasn‘t on an “evergreen” operating system (or hardware).
and his takeaway:
The real-life impact of our technical decisions really hit home to me once again: my Mom had trouble volunteering and participating in her local community because somebody shipped the optional chaining operator in their production JavaScript.
Be thoughtful out there.

Browsix is a framework that bridges the considerable gap between conventional operating systems and the browser, enabling unmodified programs expecting a Unix-like environment to run directly in the browser. Browsix does this by mapping low-level Unix primitives, like processes and system calls, onto existing browser APIs, like Web Workers and postMessage.
They have examples of this tech enabling a terminal in the browser, a Latex editor, and even a client/server-based meme generator written in JS and Go.

Despite an ample amount of documentation and demos made available by Grafana Labs and community members, Grafana can be a challenge to set up (although those that do get its dashboards working generally sing its praises). Many manual configurations and steps are required when installing the different dashboard options. Once installed, many users can be overwhelmed with the number of logs and other data to process for monitoring and observability.
Grafana sure does produce pretty (useful) dashboards 👇, but I do find it overwhelming at times.

The first rule of optimization is to not do it. If you really have to though, then optimize where appropriate. Use the above profiling tools to find bottlenecks, so you don’t waste time optimizing some inconsequential piece of code. It’s also useful to create a reproducible benchmark for the piece of code you’re trying to optimize, so that you can measure the actual improvement.

The most interesting part of today’s conversation is the missing cloud native App Store. While Apple revolutionised the world with the App Store and the iPhone, we don’t yet have something similar for cloud native apps. You may be thinking “But what about OperatorHub?”, or all the Helm registries out there? The registry fragmentation, operator deprecations and lack of curation are not what people have in mind when they think App Store. But there is more to it, so let’s hear how Alexis thinks about this.

When I started to host more and more stuff with docker, I first just migrated that approach to docker and put it all in a container. That still required me to mess around with config files. Once I started to host postgres containers it all got even more complicated. Thus, I needed a new solution.
I built this tool to make backups easy: Simply point it to a host running docker containers and it will automatically inspect and find all mysql/mariadb and postgres containers and do backups of them on a schedule. No configuration required, it “just works”.

CSS Fingerprinting is a technique of tracking and gathering information on site visitors. This method exploits the nature of CSS to track various characteristics about the visitor’s browser and device, which can later be used to either identify or track said visitor.
Right now, at current spec, this method doesn’t scale, but with the next upcoming draft of the CSS specification, CSS Values 4, it will become far more scalable and precise.

Without dura, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state. That’s so 2021. Computers crash and Ctrl-Z only works on files independently. Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can revert to “4 hours ago” instead of “hit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever”. Finally, some sanity.
This sounds a lot like how Fossil works out of the box, except maybe even more paranoid because Fossil will propagate every commit whereas Dura propagates all changes even before they’re committed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RSS-Bridge is a PHP project capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don’t have one. It can be used on webservers or as a stand-alone application in CLI mode.
I made a very poor-man’s version of this as my first ever Sinatra app way back in the day. It’s cool to see that vision live on, but it sucks that tools like this have to exist. It seems that the author agrees with me on that:
We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have your service with your applications using your API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.
We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

Super cool, but with a disclaimer: this is the result of reverse engineering the transfer protocol, so the odds of it being flakey (especially as Apple ships OS updates) are high. It’d be rad if Apple would publish an AirDrop-compatible specification for the community to rally around.
You know, like they did with FaceTime. 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the first (of probably many) “playing with generics” post we’ll see now that Go 1.18 is in beta with official support for the controversial feature.
This post aims to describe my initial experience converting my markphelps/optional library from using code generation to using generics instead. Hopefully, after reading this post you’ll have a better understanding of what generics can do for you and what they can’t.
Mark shares lots of good tips along the way. His findings are quite positive:
I ❤️ that I was able to delete 95% of my code because of generics.
I think that generics will be very beneficial to maintainers who create libraries for things like my own as well as for searching, sorting, transformations, and the like. I can also see some them being extremely helpful for creating well-tested libraries around the various concurrency patterns that are sometimes tricky to get right.

Microservices are getting natural and we almost feel like we’ve been always living in the world of microservices. Lately when I talked to other developers and asked how they would start a greenfield project, almost certainly the answer was, well, one microservice for this, another one for this, another one for user management, one more for authentication, another for authorization, one more for session management, and the list could go on.
I’m gonna try to shed some light on what nobody is talking about when it comes to microservices. And yeah, it’s gonna be a first-hand experience from a past projects I worked on.
This excellent piece gave me some serious deja vu of [Kelsey Hightower’s monoliths are the future. I’m quite looking forward to Arnold’s upcoming “chapter 2” of the story.

The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform remote code execution by exploiting the insecure JNDI lookups feature exposed by the logging library log4j. This exploitable feature was enabled by default in many versions of the library.

One cool example is you can hide API keys from shoulder surfers (and history’s memory) by storing the key encrypted on disk and using pass to access it at runtime:
curl -H "API-Key: $(pass provider/api_key)" ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2014 Gerhard joined CloudCredo, a startup co-founded by Colin Humphreys, Paula Kennedy & Chris Hedley. They stuck together through two acquisitions: Pivotal & VMware. This year, Colin, Paula & Chris co-founded Syntasso, the Platform-as-a-Product startup.
Today they all get together to talk about about what it takes to build a platform team, why Team Topologies is a good conversation starter and why a curated blend of off-the-shelf, composed, and self-created services are required in any organisation operating at scale.
Your hunch is right, all of them used to share the same Pivotal London office with Tammer Saleh, our guest from episode 31. Chris used to win all table tennis matches without even breaking a sweat, and today Gerhard gets his comeback. Touché!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A post from back in June resurfaced this week in light of the big Rails 7 release.
I learned to code in the JavaScript stack and am building a JavaScript based product. I never questioned this stack: many companies default to it, JS everywhere seems good, and the community is big. But for my new side project I decided to try Rails because despite some perception that Ruby on Rails is ‘over’, people in HN comments say it was somehow more enjoyable than the newer Node based stack. Having tried it I can say wow - coming from the current Javascript ecosystem makes discovering Rails a revelation.
If you make your technology choices because of “perception that $TECHNOLOGY is ‘over’”, you are missing out on a world of potentially great options.

The discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability has set the internet on fire. Similar to shellshock and heartbleed, Log4Shell is just the latest catastrophic vulnerability in software that runs the internet. Our mission as the Google Open Source Security Team is to secure the open source libraries the world depends on, such as Log4j. One of our capabilities in this space is OSS-Fuzz, a free fuzzing service that is used by over 500 critical open source projects and has found more than 7,000 vulnerabilities in its lifetime. 
We want to empower open source developers to secure their code on their own. Over the next year we will work on better automated detection of non-memory corruption vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell. We have star…]]></summary>

This version of Rails has been years in the conceptual making. It’s the fulfillment of a vision to present a truly full-stack approach to web development that tackles both the front- and back-end challenges with equal vigor. An omakase menu that includes everything from the aperitif to the dessert.
There’s a lot to like about the new Node-free approach to the frontend, at-work encryption added to Active Record, a new auto-loading strategy, and more. Congrats to the hundreds of contributors who worked on this major milestone!

Mess With DNS gives you a real subdomain, and it’s running a real DNS server (the address is mess-with-dns1.wizardzines.com). The interesting thing about DNS is that it’s a global system with many different computers interacting, and so I wanted people to be able to actually see that system in action.
