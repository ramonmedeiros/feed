        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Johnson, the creator of Litestream, joined Fly.io a few weeks after we migrated changelog.com - episode 50 has all the details. That was pure coincidence. What was not a coincidence, is Gerhard jumping at the opportunity to talk to Ben about Postgres vs SQLite with Litestream.
The prospect of running a cluster of our app instances spread across all regions, with local SQLite & Litestream replication, is mind boggling. Let’s find out from Ben what will it take to get there.  Thanks Kürt for kicking off this dream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that teaches computer programs how to take in, interpret, and produce language from large data sets. For example, grammar checkers use NLP to come up with grammar suggestions that help people write grammatically correct phrases. But as Google’s AI Principles note, it’s sometimes necessary to have human intervention to identify risks of unfair bias.


Sunipa Dev is a research scientist at Google who focuses on Responsible AI. Some of her work focuses specifically on ways to evaluate unfair bias in NLP outcomes, reducing harms for people with queer and non-binary identities. Sunipa’s work was recently featured at a workshop at the ACM Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAcct) conference in Seoul, Korea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Miguel Grinberg built a SQLite-backed web app for the blogging team at Twilio to track their effectiveness that started to respond slugishly when it grew much bigger than he expected (6.5 million individual daily traffic records, and with a user base that grew to over 200 employees).
He thought this might be a good time to switch to Postgres, but he wasn’t sure if the wins he expected would be realized:
Having publicly professed my dislike of performance benchmarks, I resisted the urge to look up any comparisons online, and instead embarked on a series of experiments to accurately measure the performance of these two databases for the specific use cases of this application.
In this in-depth article on Twilio’s blog (no doubt being tracked by Miguel’s web app as we speak) he goes into the details of his efforts with lots of interesting findings along the way (even a plot twist!). I’ll leave you with this statement from the end:
If you are going to take one thing away from this article, I hope it is that the only benchmarks that are valuable are those that run on your own platform, with your own stack, with your own data, and with your own software. And even then, you may need to add custom optimizations to get the best performance.

Does the company have product-market fit? How much runway does the company have? Does their spending look within reason? What’s the culture like? And more tough questions that you really should be asking before accepting that offer.

The large amount of high dimensional biological data that is available today, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, creates unique opportunities to push the boundaries of what is possible in biology.
To that end, Immunai has built the largest immune database called AMICA that contains tens of millions of cells. The company uses cutting-edge transfer learning techniques to transfer knowledge across different cell types, studies, and even species.

A PRQL query is a linear pipeline of transformations
Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line’s result. This makes it easy to read, and simple to write.
It compiles to SQL, which means it’s compatible with most databases already and there are currently bindings for Python, JS & Rust, which is the compiler itself.
Try it out in their web-based playground. (Thanks, Wasm!)

The Linux 5.20 merge window will open following the release of Linux 5.19 stable around the end of July, so at that point we’ll see if the Rust PR is submitted and lands for this next kernel version. It wouldn’t be too surprising with how things have been pacing and already having the blessing of Linus.
Lots of positivity about this in the attached comment thread.

These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.
Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models — Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches.

Figuring out what the problems, finding a potential solution to that problem, and then building that solution all take a decent chunk of time and effort. It’s due to this process that the minimum viable product was born. The motivation for building an MVP is still valid. Build something small and easy to test, launch quickly, and pivot or trash it if it doesn’t perform as desired.
There is another, less selfish way.
I read an article by Jason Cohen a few years ago which changed the way I think about product development. Instead of building MVPs, we should be building SLCs. Something Simple, Loveable, and Complete.
I like the thinking behind SLCs. So simple, so loveable, so…
Hat tip to Henry Snopek for linking this up in the #gotimefm channel of Gophers Slack! When it comes to thinking about your projects, Henry says:
I like to use MVP for fast projects, and SLC for “effective” projects…
Yeah, I like that framing too. So simple, so loveable, so…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AppleInsider explains Apple’s new Private Access Tokens (PAT) tech announced at WWDC:
Using a new HTTP authentication method called PrivateToken, a server uses cryptography to verify a client passed an iCloud attestation check.
When the client needs a token it contacts an attester — in this case, Apple — which performs the process using certificates stored in the device’s Secure Enclave.
I’ve been waiting for someone to kill CAPTCHAs for us, but this will be an Apple-only solution for now:
The company is working to help make Private Access Tokens a web standard, but there is no mention of tokens working on Android or Windows. People on those platforms may have to put up with CAPTCHAs, for now — or wait for Microsoft’s and Google’s work on the matter.
I believe this is the draft of the standard that they’re referring to. Cloudflare also has a nice article on their work in this space.

I tell people this all the time when they ask me for advice. I’ll still give them my advice. But it comes with the disclaimer that I really have no idea what I’m doing. 😆

The apps you make are lean and performant, which reduces electricity, storage space, and general natural resource consumption. Every byte saved is a leaf on a tree that gets to grow.
This project has gotten a lot of early interest because, well, people have been waiting for an Electron alternative to emerge. Now that Tauri is 1.0 I’m guessing adoption will really start to take off.
Even more good news: we have an episode on Tauri in the hopper for ya 💪

The full datasets of these services range in the few pebibytes(PiB), making them impractical to query using non-distributed systems.
This project aims to make subsets such data easier to access and query using SQL.
Crawl a site with wget and import it into WarcDB:
wget --warc-file changelog "https://changelog.com"

warcdb import archive.warcdb changelog.warc.gz

Then you can query away using SQL, such as this one to get all response headers:
sqlite3 archive.warcdb <<SQL
select  json_extract(h.value, '$.header') as header, 
        json_extract(h.value, '$.value') as value

That being said, sometimes you just have to follow the other person’s path until you realize when it doesn’t actually work for you. I’m totally fine with cargo-culting some sort of rule… I was gonna say the Law of Demeter, but that one’s too hard to explain. What’s a very simple – DRY, right?
See how quickly I abandoned ship there? Ok, it’s not that hard to explain. I just didn’t feel like taking the time to explain it when it wasn’t even my point. Good thing Double Agent Caleb Hearth did a nice write-up on Test Double’s blog about it!

Application frameworks most often define SSR as the alternative to SSG (static site generation). A runtime server is used to render the components on request.
Component frameworks define SSR as generating static HTML from a component definition. They offer no preference as to whether this should or can happen at build time or at request-time.

The past year has seen an industry-wide effort to embrace Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)—a list of all the components, libraries, and modules that are required to build a piece of software. In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what’s in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it’s impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components—including those produced by others. This increased interest in SBOMs saw another boost after the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its Secure Software Development Framework, which requires SBOM information t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sid and the GitLab team continue to enjoy their Rails-based “modular monolith”
A modular monolith is the exact opposite of a distributed ball of mud: a well-structured, well-architected, highly modular program that runs as a single process and is as boring as possible.
Sid doesn’t pull any punches. No regrets!
Wouldn’t it be better to have a proper plugin interface? Or better yet, a services interface modeled on microservices? In a word: no. Not only do these approaches impose deployment and integration hurdles that go far beyond “I made a small change to the source code,” they often enforce architectural constraints too rigidly. Anticipating all the future extension points is a fool’s errand, one that we luckily did not embark on and do not have to.

No JS is shipped to the client by default
No build step
No configuration required
TypeScript support out of the box
If you’re feeling some JavaScript and/or Framework Fatigue, this won’t help. But competition pushes everyone (Next, Remix, etc) to improve. So, whether you check Fresh out or not, hopefully it’ll have a positive impact on your work.

I’m going with “renaissance”, because despite its already mass adoption, there has been something of a rebirth of interest from one software sector that had previously relegated it to dev & test environments1: web apps
We asked SQLite creator Richard Hipp about his database’s gap in penetration back when we first told the story of SQLite’s success in 2016:
Now for a website where you’ve got a lot of write concurrency, you need to move to a client-server database engine because you need that server process there to coordinate the concurrency… There’s just no way to do that in a serverless database like SQLite. So for so many things you don’t have that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nolan Lawson:
Anyone who’s worked in the tech industry for long enough, especially at larger organizations, has seen it before. A legacy system exists: it’s big, it’s complex, and no one fully understands how it works. Architects are brought in to “fix” the system. They might wheel out a big whiteboard showing a lot of boxes and arrows pointing at other boxes, and inevitably, their solution is… to add more boxes and arrows. Nobody can subtract from the system; everyone just adds.
Nolan posits the center cannot hold and the current market shift from bull to bear might help bring the collapse of complex software. But it’s never that simple, is it?
One thing working in complexity’s favor, though, is that engineers like complexity. Admit it: as much as we complain about other people’s complexity, we love our own. We love sitting around and dreaming up new architectural diagrams that can comfortably sit inside our own heads – it’s only when these diagrams leave our heads, take shape in the real world, and outgrow the size of any one person’s head that the problems begin.

Generative art is a creative process. While recent advances of DALL·E unleash people’s creativity, having a single-prompt-single-output UX/UI locks the imagination to a single possibility, which is bad no matter how fine this single result is. DALL·E Flow is an alternative to the one-liner, by formalizing the generative art as an iterative procedure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub will archive all projects under the Atom org on December 15, 2022. Why?
Atom has not had significant feature development for the past several years, though we’ve conducted maintenance and security updates during this period to ensure we’re being good stewards of the project and product. As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we’ve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.
Atom was co-founder and long-time CEO Chris Wanstrath’s baby. We first heard its story from project lead Nathan Sobo on The Changelog back in 2017. Here’s what he had to say about the end of Atom’s era:
As Atom’s sun sets, Zed’s sun is rising. We’re not done here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lars Wikman on the history of ID3 tags:
If you were a Winamp user back in the day, or curate an MP3 collection currently, you might recognize the humble ID3 tag. It is what the metadata in the MP3 file is made up of. First it was pretty limited in the version later dubbed ID3v1. Like any good 2.0 they added a ton more fields, features, removed character limits and it was suddenly ID3v2. The latest spec is ID3v2.4 while the most commonly adopted one seems to be ID3v2.3. I recently found myself having a reason to dig into this specification.
I wonder what reason he might have to dig into this spec? Could it be for a soon-to-be-announced collab with his friends at Changelog? 😏
This post is not about the technical intricacies of the format… This is about a simpler time, where people saw the wild possibilities of music on computers and when people cared about files, damnit. This is about some of the most interesting and entertaining things I’ve run across while reading the spec.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the smaller (but big for webdevs) announcements from yesterday’s WWDC keynote was Web Push coming to Safari. It’s built on three web standards all working together. What does it do, well it enables websites to “notify their users of time-sensitive or high-priority events, even if the user does not currently have the site open.”
As long as you’ve coded your web application to the standards you will be able to reach Safari 16 users on macOS Ventura. You don’t need to join the Apple Developer Program to send Web Push notifications.
That’s good news, but is this feature something users want? I can think of zero websites that I’ve allowed to send me notifications even when Safari is open, let alone when I’m not even browsing the web.
Jen Simmons posted a nice thread on Twitter alongside the announcement and fielded many people’s questions/concerns along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christopher Meiklejohn has been working for two years on developing an automated resilience testing tool called Filibuster and was able to test it out at DoorDash during his research internship:
Access to DoorDash’s real-world industrial microservice application was extremely valuable both to ensure that Filibuster’s design matches how microservice applications are developed today and to influence future features that I would not have identified in a lab setting.
The results were pretty good! Maybe we won’t need chaos monkeys as tools like Filibuster advance?
In short, Filibuster can identify many of the technical resilience issues that exist in applications earlier, at the time of development, without testing in production as required in more traditional chaos engineering techniques.

        <updated>2022-06-06T14:51:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Victor Engmark thinks we should start test names with “should” for a handful of reasons, here’s a few:
It removes redundancy, because the function name should already be in the call stack.
It is falsifiable, a person reviewing the test can decide to which degree the name agrees with the actual test.
It encourages testing one property of the function per test
I don’t disagree, but I like to take it a step further: Let the “should” be implied by the rest of the test name.
Instead of: should replace children when updating instance
I prefer: replaces children when updating instances
Instead of: should apply discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
I prefer: applies discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
Most of Victor’s reasons for using “should” still apply with this format, but it’s less verbose and more accurately describes the software working as expected when the tests pass.

2021 was another record-breaking year for our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). We paid a total of $8.7 million in rewards, our highest amount yet. 2021 saw some amazing work from the security research community. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the reports we received were for findings in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. It is heartening to see an increasing number of talented researchers getting involved in cloud security.
We first announced the GCP VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of GCP, in turn helping us make GCP more secure for our users, customers, and the internet at large. Even 3 years into the program, the submissions we are getting never cea…]]></summary>

Connect is production-ready — focused, simple, and debuggable — and it’s fully compatible with gRPC clients and servers. If you’re frustrated by the complexity and instability of today’s gRPC libraries, we think you’ll find Connect a breath of fresh air.

To this moment, I co-authored teloxide and dptree, wrote several publications and translated a number of language release announcements. I also managed to write some production code in Rust, and had a chance to speak at one online meetup dedicated to Rust. Still, from time to time I find myself disputing with Rust’s borrow checker and type system for no practical reason. Yes, I am no longer stupefied by such errors as cannot return reference to temporary value – over time, I developed multiple heuristic strategies to cope with lifetimes…

If you ask me - there’s pretty much nothing we can do that would suddenly make Emacs as popular as VS Code. But you know what - that’s perfectly fine. After all there are plenty of “modern” editors that are even less popular than Emacs, so clearly being “modern” doesn’t make you popular. And there’s also our “arch-nemesis” vim, that’s supposedly as “dated” as Emacs, but is extremely popular.

Decoupled compute and storage. So the idea is that you should be able to attach the compute part of it to a storage, hopefully like an infinite storage; you know, anything that is infinitely scalable. If you can do this, and in particular, if the compute can start up very fast, maybe in, say, a hundred milliseconds via some sort of HTTP response, then that’s cloud native, yeah.
Enter Neon, which sells itself as:
The multi-cloud fully managed Postgres with a generous free tier. We separated storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage.
