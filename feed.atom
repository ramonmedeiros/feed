Nobody likes preventable site errors, but they happen disappointingly often. 



The last thing you want your customers to see is a dreaded 'Your connection is not private' error instead of the service they expected to reach. Most certificate errors are preventable and one of the best ways to help prevent issues is by automating your certificate lifecycle using the ACME standard. Google Trust Services now offers our ACME API to all users with a Google Cloud account (referred to as “users” here), allowing them to automatically acquire and renew publicly-trusted TLS certificates for free.

Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
That’s a hard pill to swallow, especially when your project is late. But it’s a truth pill, which makes it worth choking down. Here’s another truth pill that Brooks wrote in his paper No Silver Bullet–Essence and Accident in Software Engineering:
