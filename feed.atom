        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nick Nisi shared this with me recently and it’s cool, so I thought I’d pass it along. Here’s Nick describing it:
And it is a visual wrapper around jq, that kind of does the fzf type thing where as you’re writing out your query, it’s live showing you a preview in virtual text of exactly what would get returned by what you’re querying as you go. So you can use that as a nice tool to build out your jq syntax, or your jq query, and in real time get that feedback.
The only bummer is that it’s written in Ruby. Don’t get me wrong, I love Ruby. But it requires you to have Ruby tooling on your machine to use jqq, which many people don’t have or want. BUT it’s a mere 241 lines of code, so porting it to something a little more portable shouldn’t be too much work…

Why let JS have all the fun? With mix-blend-mode finally gaining wide browser-support, we now have access to many of most common shading techniques in CSS. With some choice images and a bit of careful layering it’s possible to build some surprisingly high-quality effects without the need for introducing any JS dependencies.
If you’ve ever used Photoshop’s Blend Modes… you can basically do that in CSS now. So cool! Check out Robb’s entire article. He includes a lot of great examples.

While most teams I talk to would love to be able to run A/B tests to accurately assess the performance impact of certain changes, the problem is pretty much every popular A/B testing tool on the market has such a negative impact on load performance that they’re essentially unusable for this purpose.
If you’re just trying to determine which of two marketing headlines converts better, then perhaps this performance difference isn’t so bad. But if you’re wanting to run an A/B test to determine whether inlining your CSS in the <head> of your pages will improve your FCP, well, those popular A/B testing tools are just not going to cut it.
He goes on to describe his process for running performant A/B tests on his static site using Cloudflare workers to swap in/out his experiments.

Bun is competing with Node and Deno, with the following goals:
Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).
I like those goals, and it’s designed to be a drop-in replacement for your current runtime.

You don’t need to look far on web dev social media to find somebody lecturing everybody and nobody about how you should do web development. Hell, I’ve been guilty of that myself.
You should use this or that framework.
Or, you should not use this or that framework and instead use a cognitive framework like Model-View-Controller with ‘vanilla’ web components.
No, no, no Functional Reactive is where it’s at.
You should be writing code test-first and unit test everything.
Or, you should go light on the unit tests and focus instead on integration tests.
Or, end-to-end tests. Just test the shit out of the actual running app.
Or, you should use this different kind of unit test which doesn’t look anything like that other kind of unit test.
Those aren’t integration tests! This is an integration test! What’s wrong with you?!
Sound familiar? Unfortunately, you don’t get to be a “famous” social media influencer by posting reasoned, nuanced takes that end with something like: “I dunno, this works for me but it may not for you. It depends…”

This post turns out to be less about Kubernetes and more about premature optimization and doing more with less. Also it’s about Kubernetes. 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After many years of gradual improvement Vim now takes a big step with a major release. Besides many small additions the spotlight is on a new incarnation of the Vim script language: Vim9 script.
One of Neovim’s major draws is that you can avoid Vim script altogether and use Lua instead. It looks like the Vim team is addressing the two major complaints folks have with Vim script: performance and its obscure syntax:
The main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.
A secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer to commonly used programming languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript and Java.
Legacy scripts will continue to work, of course. The Vim team has no plans to drop legacy support in the foreseeable future. Learn more about Vim9 script here or with :help vim9 inside Vim itself.

As a senior interaction designer on the People + AI Research (PAIR) team, she designed Data Cards to help everyone better understand the contexts of the data they are using. The Data Cards Playbook puts Google’s AI Principles into practice by providing opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations and appeal.

The prospect of running a cluster of our app instances spread across all regions, with local SQLite & Litestream replication, is mind boggling. Let’s find out from Ben what will it take to get there.  Thanks Kürt for kicking off this dream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that teaches computer programs how to take in, interpret, and produce language from large data sets. For example, grammar checkers use NLP to come up with grammar suggestions that help people write grammatically correct phrases. But as Google’s AI Principles note, it’s sometimes necessary to have human intervention to identify risks of unfair bias.


Sunipa Dev is a research scientist at Google who focuses on Responsible AI. Some of her work focuses specifically on ways to evaluate unfair bias in NLP outcomes, reducing harms for people with queer and non-binary identities. Sunipa’s work was recently featured at a workshop at the ACM Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAcct) conference in Seoul, Korea.

He thought this might be a good time to switch to Postgres, but he wasn’t sure if the wins he expected would be realized:
Having publicly professed my dislike of performance benchmarks, I resisted the urge to look up any comparisons online, and instead embarked on a series of experiments to accurately measure the performance of these two databases for the specific use cases of this application.
In this in-depth article on Twilio’s blog (no doubt being tracked by Miguel’s web app as we speak) he goes into the details of his efforts with lots of interesting findings along the way (even a plot twist!). I’ll leave you with this statement from the end:
If you are going to take one thing away from this article, I hope it is that the only benchmarks that are valuable are those that run on your own platform, with your own stack, with your own data, and with your own software. And even then, you may need to add custom optimizations to get the best performance.

Does the company have product-market fit? How much runway does the company have? Does their spending look within reason? What’s the culture like? And more tough questions that you really should be asking before accepting that offer.

The large amount of high dimensional biological data that is available today, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, creates unique opportunities to push the boundaries of what is possible in biology.
To that end, Immunai has built the largest immune database called AMICA that contains tens of millions of cells. The company uses cutting-edge transfer learning techniques to transfer knowledge across different cell types, studies, and even species.

A PRQL query is a linear pipeline of transformations
Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line’s result. This makes it easy to read, and simple to write.
It compiles to SQL, which means it’s compatible with most databases already and there are currently bindings for Python, JS & Rust, which is the compiler itself.
Try it out in their web-based playground. (Thanks, Wasm!)

The Linux 5.20 merge window will open following the release of Linux 5.19 stable around the end of July, so at that point we’ll see if the Rust PR is submitted and lands for this next kernel version. It wouldn’t be too surprising with how things have been pacing and already having the blessing of Linus.
Lots of positivity about this in the attached comment thread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rob Barnes (a.k.a. Devops Rob) and Rosemary Wang (author of Infrastructure as Code - Patterns & Practices) are joining us today to talk about infrastructure secrets.
What do Rosemary and Rob think about committing encrypted secrets into a repository? How do they suggest that we improve on storing secrets in LastPass? And if we were to choose HashiCorp Vault, what do we need to know?
Thank you Thomas Eckert for the intro. Thank you Nabeel Sulieman (ep. 46) & Kelsey Hightower (ep. 44) for your gentle nudges towards improving our infra secrets management.

Or a picture of two robots having a romantic evening at the movies? These might sound far-fetched, but a novel type of machine learning technology called text-to-image generation makes them possible. These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.
Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models — Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches. We want to share a little more about how these models work and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building products is a difficult and time-consuming effort. Figuring out what the problems, finding a potential solution to that problem, and then building that solution all take a decent chunk of time and effort. It’s due to this process that the minimum viable product was born. The motivation for building an MVP is still valid. Build something small and easy to test, launch quickly, and pivot or trash it if it doesn’t perform as desired.
There is another, less selfish way.
I read an article by Jason Cohen a few years ago which changed the way I think about product development. Instead of building MVPs, we should be building SLCs. Something Simple, Loveable, and Complete.
I like the thinking behind SLCs. So simple, so loveable, so…
Hat tip to Henry Snopek for linking this up in the #gotimefm channel of Gophers Slack! When it comes to thinking about your projects, Henry says:
I like to use MVP for fast projects, and SLC for “effective” projects…
Yeah, I like that framing too. So simple, so loveable, so…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AppleInsider explains Apple’s new Private Access Tokens (PAT) tech announced at WWDC:
Using a new HTTP authentication method called PrivateToken, a server uses cryptography to verify a client passed an iCloud attestation check.
When the client needs a token it contacts an attester — in this case, Apple — which performs the process using certificates stored in the device’s Secure Enclave.
I’ve been waiting for someone to kill CAPTCHAs for us, but this will be an Apple-only solution for now:
The company is working to help make Private Access Tokens a web standard, but there is no mention of tokens working on Android or Windows. People on those platforms may have to put up with CAPTCHAs, for now — or wait for Microsoft’s and Google’s work on the matter.
I believe this is the draft of the standard that they’re referring to. Cloudflare also has a nice article on their work in this space.

The apps you make are lean and performant, which reduces electricity, storage space, and general natural resource consumption. Every byte saved is a leaf on a tree that gets to grow.
This project has gotten a lot of early interest because, well, people have been waiting for an Electron alternative to emerge. Now that Tauri is 1.0 I’m guessing adoption will really start to take off.

The past year has seen an industry-wide effort to embrace Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)—a list of all the components, libraries, and modules that are required to build a piece of software. In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what’s in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it’s impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components—including those produced by others. This increased interest in SBOMs saw another boost after the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its Secure Software Development Framework, which requires SBOM information t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An ever-expanding attack surface is a global concern for most organizations and complicates an M&A, especially for CISOs. The M&A prospect may have a partially unprotected attack surface, thus increasing security risk coming in the form of a gap between the attack surface they can and do protect and the attack surface (and accompanying assets) they need to defend. This gap is what many M&A prospects bring to the table. And while an M&A may have undisputed business and strategic value, CISOs must still address the security risks involved in acquiring another organization's assets and its current attack surface, fully protected or not.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sid and the GitLab team continue to enjoy their Rails-based “modular monolith”
A modular monolith is the exact opposite of a distributed ball of mud: a well-structured, well-architected, highly modular program that runs as a single process and is as boring as possible.
Sid doesn’t pull any punches. No regrets!
Wouldn’t it be better to have a proper plugin interface? Or better yet, a services interface modeled on microservices? In a word: no. Not only do these approaches impose deployment and integration hurdles that go far beyond “I made a small change to the source code,” they often enforce architectural constraints too rigidly. Anticipating all the future extension points is a fool’s errand, one that we luckily did not embark on and do not have to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fresh is in the “SSR with client-side progressive enhancement” camp. I have to admit their list of ‘stand out’ features are quite appealing:
No JS is shipped to the client by default
No build step
No configuration required
TypeScript support out of the box
If you’re feeling some JavaScript and/or Framework Fatigue, this won’t help. But competition pushes everyone (Next, Remix, etc) to improve. So, whether you check Fresh out or not, hopefully it’ll have a positive impact on your work.
