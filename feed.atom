        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week on The Changelog we’re talking about Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and the impact of AI generated art. We invited our good friend Simon Willison on the show today because he wrote a very thorough blog post titled, “Stable Diffusion is a really big deal.”
You may know Simon from his extensive contributions to open source software. Simon is a co-creator of the Django Web framework (which we don’t talk about at all on this show), he’s the creator of Datasette, a multi-tool for exploring and publishing data (which we do talk about on this show)…most of all Simon is a very insightful thinker, which he puts on display here on this episode. We talk from all the angles of this topic, the technical, the innovation, the future and possibilities, the ethical and the moral – we get into it all. …]]></summary>

This gets an A+ for creativity. Fire up your shell, then launch Neovim. Then shell out with :VimShell to get back to where you started, but with Copilot suggestions.
My guess is the ergonomics of this are… bad. But a cool hack, regardless!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Devon Zuegel draws a comparison that I would’ve never thought of:
Pirate crews developed a surprisingly similar approach to compensation in the 17th century. Just like many startups, they also balanced equity incentives with other mechanisms that would be familiar to a startup employee today, such as bonuses.
These surprising similarities offer an interesting frame through which we can reflect on why startup equity and bonuses are structured the way they are. We can learn a lot about the theory of compensation in modern companies by looking at how pirates designed incentives to organize and motivate their work.
Maybe it’s time to stop hiring “frontend wizards” and start looking for “frontend pirates” instead, matey.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Adrian Taylor, Bartek Nowierski and Kentaro Hara on behalf of the MiraclePtr team 
Memory safety bugs are the most numerous category of Chrome security issues and we’re continuing to investigate many solutions – both in C++ and in new programming languages. The most common type of memory safety bug is the “use-after-free”. We recently posted about an exciting series of technologies designed to prevent these. Those technologies (collectively, *Scan, pronounced “star scan”) are very powerful but likely require hardware support for sufficient performance. 
Today we’re going to talk about a different approach to solving the same type of bugs. 
It’s hard, if not impossible, to avoid use-after-frees in a non-trivial codebase. It’s rarely a mistake by a single programmer. Instead, one p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of ink has been spilt over the years trying to elucidate the divide between junior and senior. Miłosz Piechocki makes the distinction this way:
Junior Engineers care about writing Software. They value code quality, employ best practices, try to adopt cutting-edge technologies. They invest a lot of time into learning new technologies. To them, the ultimate goal is to create elegant, performant, maintainable software.
Senior Engineers care about building Systems. To them, creating software is just one of the steps. First of all, they question whether the software needs to be built in the first place. They ask what problems would it solve and why it’s important to solve them. They inquire who will be using the software and on what scale. They think about where the software would run and how they’re going to monitor whether it’s working properly. They also decide how to measure whether the software is actually solving the problems it was supposed to solve.
He goes on to describe how hard it is to build Systems and lists activities that are part of that process.

Software quality is more the result of a system designed to produce quality, and not so much the result of individual performance. That is: a group of mediocre programmers working with a structure designed to produce quality will produce better software than a group of fantastic programmers working in a system designed with other goals.
What does he mean by “a system designed for quality”? Read on to see for yourself..

Recently, OSS-Fuzz—our community fuzzing service that regularly checks 700 critical open source projects for bugs—detected a serious vulnerability (CVE-2022-3008): a bug in the TinyGLTF project that could have allowed attackers to execute malicious code in projects using TinyGLTF as a dependency.   
The bug was soon patched, but the wider significance remains: OSS-Fuzz caught a trivially exploitable command injection vulnerability. This discovery shows that fuzzing, a type of testing once primarily known for detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, has considerable untapped potential to find broader classes of vulnerabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Josh Collinsworth (an unapologetic React non-fan) writes on his blog about the ubiquity of React:
I don’t know what the future of front-end looks like. Nobody really does. But it’s a very safe bet that React will continue to be the thing for a very long time.
If you’re learning front-end development in the hopes of getting a job, or trying to level up your career, and React is a knowledge gap for you, it seems like the safest bet you could make. React isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. That said, however…
But why does React remain on top?
Because we don’t always value the strongest choice as much as we value consensus. (In fact, you could make an argument that consensus is the strongest choice, in many ways.)
React keeps getting picked…because React keeps getting picked.
But there’s a ton more to unpack. Josh got into the details on the best choice for the job, covering: Performance, learning curve, bundle size, scalability, community and support, financial backing, hireability, and developer experience.
Should I spoil it for you? Nah. Read Josh’s words for the full story.

        <updated>2022-09-08T13:22:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s Natasha Lekh from Apify describing the project:
This project really is a culmination of 4 years of work trying to make the best library for web scraping in production. Web scraping is a very dynamic environment and what works today might not work tomorrow, so we at Apify had to go through a lot of trial and error to figure out the most reliable and convenient ways of crawling the web and scraping data. We hope that we finally cracked it and that now many developers will enjoy working with our new library and it will make their scrapers more reliable and time to production faster.
I like how it starts with simple HTTP-based scraping, but can switch to browser-based automation when a site has JavaScript rendering. I don’t love the built-in proxy rotation features. Not because they’re bad, per se, but because they make spammers lives easier…

        <updated>2022-09-07T14:47:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Preact team dropped a new state management solution on us:
Signals are a way of expressing state that ensure apps stay fast regardless of how complex they get. Signals are based on reactive principles and provide excellent developer ergonomics, with a unique implementation optimized for Virtual DOM.
Adding Signals to your Preact app only adds 1.6kB to your bundle size. So what’s the big idea?
The main idea behind signals is that instead of passing a value directly through the component tree, we pass a signal object containing the value (similar to a ref). When a signal’s value changes, the signal itself stays the same. As a result, signals can be updated without re-rendering the components they’ve been passed through, since components see the signal and not its value. This lets us skip all of the expensive work of rendering components and jump immediately to the specific components in the tree that actually access the signal’s value.

Go provides tooling to analyze your codebase and surface known vulnerabilities. This tooling is backed by the Go vulnerability database, which is curated by the Go security team. Go’s tooling reduces noise in your results by only surfacing vulnerabilities in functions that your code is actually calling.
There’s a new govulncheck command you can/should install and run against your project. It surfaces only the vulnerabilities that actually affect you, which is awesome.
Govulncheck is a standalone tool to allow frequent updates and rapid iteration while we gather feedback from users. In the long term, we plan to integrate the govulncheck tool into the main Go distribution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of messaging (today), you have behemoths like WhatsApp and iMessage, and they are “backed by some of the richest companies in the world.” And then there’s Signal. It’s run by a nonprofit and pretty much operates as the exact opposite — they are committed to end-to-end encryption, does not collect or store sensitive information, or backups of user data.
This post from Nitasha Tiku on The Washington Post gives a detailed backstory on Meredith Whittaker, former Google manager, and her arrival to Signal as President (and board member since 2020), as well as why Signal “hopes to support itself with small donations from millions of users.”
The only way to escape technology that makes money off your data is by paying for products that don’t, Whittaker says. An alternative to data collection only exists if the community of people who rely on it “kick in a little bit,” she said.
Signal is one of the few successful tech products, like the Firefox browser, led by vociferous critics of Big Tech. The app offers end-to-end encryption on group text, voice and video chat, does not collect or store sensitive information and does not store backups of your data on its servers — a viable alternative to relentless data gathering at the center of tech industry critiques.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many software engineers, Matt Bilyeu receives multiple emails from recruiters weekly. And, because he’s polite (and for other reasons) he tries to respond (politely) to all of them. But…
It would be ideal if I could automate sending these responses. Assuming I get four such emails per week and that it takes two minutes to read and respond to each one, automating this would save me about seven hours of administrative work per year.
Enter the GPT-3 API and some code that gets run by a future cron job (now that he’s tested this on a handful of emails) and Matt auto-responds to al the emails, continues to be polite, while also saving (his) time. It’s AI Matt responding the way real Matt would.

Stable Diffusion is a new “text-to-image diffusion model” that was released to the public by Stability.ai six days ago, on August 22nd.
It’s similar to models like Open AI’s DALL-E, but with one crucial difference: they released the whole thing.
And why it’s a really big deal:
In just a few days, there has been an explosion of innovation around it. The things people are building are absolutely astonishing.
He then details some of the innovation and it is staggering, to say the least. Open FTW!

What do you do when you need to resize the underlying disk?
The dataset is a common database store that typically grows at a pretty constant positive rate. Unless you support horizontal scaling and partitioning, you’ll need to add headroom in the disk as that dataset grows.
This is where Kubernetes falls flat on its face.

Their findings did not show a significant difference in the strategies employed by the novices and experts. Experts simply formed more correct hypotheses and were more efficient at finding the fault. The authors suspect that this result is due to the difference in the programming experience between novices and experts.

The Headway Project was born out of a frustration with the need to send current and future location data to a corporation in order to figure out how we’re getting from A to B. Offline-only maps apps can be frustrating to use, and sometimes suffer from performance problems, poor data coverage, or other technical limitations.
Headway aims to remedy these issues by bundling industry-standard software into a web app that’s easy to set up for yourself or your friends. No need to send your location data to anyone you don’t trust, not even maps.earth.

Evaluating AI’s impact on privacy from various angles, they note that ethical AI practitioners and data scientists have an enormous burden, given that much of the general population may not understand the implications of the data privacy decisions of everyday life.
This intentionally thought-provoking conversation advocates consideration and action from each listener when it comes to evaluating how their own activities either protect or violate the privacy of those whom they impact.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having a smaller website makes it load faster — that’s not surprising.
What is surprising is that a 14kB page can load much faster than a 15kB page — maybe 612ms faster — while the difference between a 15kB and a 16kB page is trivial.
The reason for this is because of how TCP works, which is nicely explained in the post. But is 14kB even a feasible reality? The author thinks so:
That 14kB includes compression — so it could actually be more like ~50kB of uncompressed data — which is generous. Consider that the Apollo 11 guidance computers only had 72kB of memory.
Once you lose the autoplaying videos, the popups, the cookies, the cookie consent banners, the social network buttons, the tracking scripts, javascript and css frameworks, and all the other junk nobody likes — you’re probably there.

By now they burnt $500K and were left with only $100K. They wanted to tryout something for one last time with the $100K. One of their Co-Founders suggested that they try to productise their open source library. Peter, the Co-Founder & CEO didn’t like that idea at all. This open-source library had only 580 lines of code, compared to the other 2 products which had 100x more lines of code and a very grand vision on how to define an industry.

In his words, “I love the early stages of company building. Hacking together code, setting up the Stripe account, getting the first customer. That’s my jam.”
We talk with Alex about this portion of his journey at Clearbit, the Catamaran he bought in South Africa and then sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and the new thing he’s building called Reflect that let’s you keep track of your notes, books, and meetings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, the end of Moore’s law has forced YouTube to make its own video chip. General purpose processors we’re cutting for the specialized task of video transcoding, and after a 10 minute meeting with YouTube chief Susan Wojcicki, the company’s first video chip project was approved.
The obvious motive for building your own chip for a specific purpose is cost savings, but that’s not always the case. In many instances, big tech companies are simply looking to create a strategic advantage with custom chips. Consolidation in the chip industry also plays into the equation, as there are now only a couple of custom chipmakers to choose from in a given category making general-purpose processors that aren’t great at specialized tasks.
Google said the Argos VCUs delivered a performance boost of anywhere between 20 to 33 times compared to traditional server hardware running well-tuned transcoding software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of our audience knows that we operate on the mantra “Slow and steady wins,” and yet there’s lessons to be learned by reading a post adjudicating the need to “Move fast or die.” Let me explain…
There’s a key phrase that sets this post and its lessons apart from us here at Changelog Media — it’s “Here’s how we did it at Facebook.” Clearly, we are not Facebook, so we should not operate on advice that’s focused on Facebook. However, we can learn something.
Of the the five lessons shared, each can be appreciated, but one in particular stands out.
We embraced asking for forgiveness, never for permission.
This, to me, is synonymous with “Hire people smarter than you,” because it assumes everyone can bring something to the table that former wisdom might not. It gives permission to try something new and see if something beautiful comes as a result. That’s a good thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, Jerod spoke with Liz Rice about the power of eBPF on The Changelog. Today, we have the pleasure of both Liz Rice, Chief Open Source Office at Isovalent & Thomas Graf, CTO & co-founder at Isovalent, the creators of Cilium.
Around 2014, Facebook achieved a 10x performance improvement by replacing their traditional load balancers with eBPF. In 2017, every single packet that went to Facebook was processed by eBPF. Nowadays, every Android phone is using it. Truth be told, if it’s network-related and it matters, eBPF is most likely a part of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI technologies continue to advance, they have the potential to unlock new experiences that support more natural human-computer interactions. We see a future where you can find the information you’re looking for in the same conversational way you speak to friends and family. While there’s still lots of work to be done before this type of human-computer interaction is possible, recent research breakthroughs in generative language models — inspired by the natural conversations of people — are accelerating our progress. One of our most promising models is called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), and as we move ahead with development, we feel a great responsibility to get this right.


That’s why we introduced an app called AI Test Kitchen at Google I/O earlier this year. It…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Pedro Barbosa, Security Engineer, and Daniel Bleichenbacher, Software Engineer
Paranoid is a project to detect well-known weaknesses in large amounts of crypto artifacts, like public keys and digital signatures. On August 3rd 2022 we open sourced the library containing the checks that we implemented so far (https://github.com/google/paranoid_crypto). The library is developed and maintained by members of the Google Security Team, but it is not an officially supported Google product.
Why the Project?
Crypto artifacts may be generated by systems with implementations unknown to us; we refer to them as “black boxes.” An artifact may be generated by a black-box if, for example, it was not generated by one of our own tools (such as Tink), or by a library that we can inspect and test usi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differentiating between what is real versus what is fake on the internet can be challenging.  Historically, AI deepfakes have only added to the confusion and chaos, but when labeled and intended for good, deepfakes can be extremely helpful.  But with all of the misinformation surrounding deepfakes, it can be hard to see the benefits they bring.  Lior Hakim, CTO at Hour One, joins Chris and Daniel to shed some light on the practical uses of deepfakes.  He addresses the AI technology behind deepfakes, how to make positive use of deep fakes such as breaking down communications barriers, and shares how Hour One specializes in the development of virtual humans for use in professional video communications.
