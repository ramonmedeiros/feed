Google’s Open Source Security Team recently sponsored a fuzzing competition as part of ISCE’s Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT) Workshop. Our goal was to encourage the development of new fuzzing techniques, which can lead to the discovery of software vulnerabilities and ultimately a safer open source ecosystem. 



The competitors’ fuzzers were judged on code coverage and their ability to discover bugs: 

HasteFuzz took the $11,337 prize for code coverage

PASTIS and AFLrustrust tied for bug discovery and split the $11,337 prize

Today, we are announcing Buzzer, a new eBPF Fuzzing framework that aims to help hardening the Linux Kernel.
What is eBPF and how does it verify safety?

eBPF is a technology that allows developers and sysadmins to easily run programs in a privileged context, like an operating system kernel. Recently, its popularity has increased, with more products adopting it as, for example, a network filtering solution. At the same time, it has maintained its relevance in the security research community, since it provides a powerful attack surface into the operating system.





While there are many solutions for fuzzing vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, they are not necessarily tailored to the unique features of eBP…]]></summary>

Safe Browsing: faster more intelligent protection

With the newest version of Safe Browsing, devices will do real-time blocklist checks for low reputation sites. Our internal analysis has found that a significant number of phishing sites only exist for less than ten minutes to try and stay ahead of block-lists.

Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don’t always have the community or support they need. That’s why we’re celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May. Today’s conversation features Alyssa Wright (Bloomberg), Chad Whitacre (Sentry), and Duane O’Brien (Creator of the FOSS Contributor Fund and framework). We get into all the details, the why, the hows, and the struggles involved for companies to support open source.

In recognition of World Password Day 2023, Google announced its next step toward a passwordless future: passkeys. 



Passkeys are a new, passwordless authentication method that offer a convenient authentication experience for sites and apps, using just a fingerprint, face scan or other screen lock. They are designed to enhance online security for users. Because they are based on the public key cryptographic protocols that underpin security keys, they are resistant to phishing and other online attacks, making them more secure than SMS, app based one-time passwords and other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA). And since passkeys are standardized, a single…]]></summary>

Unlike other mobile OSes, Android is built with a transparent, open-source architecture. We firmly believe that our users and the mobile ecosystem at-large should be able to verify Android’s security and safety and not just take our word for it. 
The Assurance of Android Protected Confirmation
announced they’re working with Google on a pilot project to establish Protected Confirmation as a common application programmable interface standard. In a pilot planned for 2023, UBS online banking customers with Pixel 6 or 7 devices can use Android Protected Confirmation backed by StrongBox, a certified hardware vault with physical attack protections, to confirm payments and verify online purchases through a hardware-based confirmation in their UBS Access App. 


Demonstrating Real-World Use for Android Protection Confirmation


We’ve been working closely with UBS to bring this pilot to life and ensure they’re able to test it on Google Pixel devices. Demonstrating real-world use cases that are enabled by Android Protected Confirmation unlocks the promise of this technology by delivering improved and innovative experiences for our users. We’re seeing interest in Android Protected Confirmation across the industry and OEMs are increasingly looking at how to build even more hardware-based confirmation into critical security user moments. We look forward to forming an industry alliance that will work together to strengthen mobile security and home in on protecting confirmation support.]]></summary>

Code at Scale
At Google, tens of thousands of software engineers contribute to a multi-billion-line mono-repository. This repository, stored in a system called Piper, contains the source code of shared libraries, production services, experimental programs, diagnostic and debugging tools: basically anything that's code-related.

This open approach can be very powerful. For example, if an engineer is unsure how to use a library, they can find examples just by searching. It also allows kind-hearted individuals to perform important updates across the whole repository, be that migrating to newer APIs, or following language developments such as Python 3, or Go generics.

Code, however, doesn't come for free: it's expensive to produce, but also costs real engineering time to mainta…]]></summary>
