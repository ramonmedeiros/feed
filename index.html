                    <span>Ryan Dahl describes the JavaScript sandbox as a higher level container for server software:
This container isn‚Äôt meant to address the same breadth of problems that Linux containers target. Its emergence is a result of its simplicity. It minimizes the boilerplate for web service business logic. It shares concepts with the browser and reduces the concepts that the programmer needs to know.
People like Ryan and his colleagues at Deno are exploring this future, but it‚Äôs not quite here yet.

What began inside of GitHub to help them thrive and connect is now available to every product team on the planet. Rewatch lets teams save, manage, and search all their video content so they can collaborate async and with greater flexibility. We talk about where the tool‚Äôs inspiration came from (spoiler alert, inside GitHub it was called GitHub TV which you‚Äôll hear during the show), how teams leverage video to reduce the constraints of communication, how Connor and his co-founder knew they had product-fit and how they grew the team and product, and of course the flip side of that ‚Äî we talk about some of Connor‚Äôs failures along the way, and knowing when it‚Äôs the right time to take a big swing.

Because of my background and life with Open Source and probably a lot because of the relative success some of my projects have had, I frequently get questions about subjects related to maintaining Open Source. How to run a project and what makes them succeed? For a long time I have been collecting lessons from my life with Open Source into a list of advice for fellow Open Source library hackers. This document is my attempt to convert those thoughts and experiences into words.
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs finished, but there‚Äôs a lot here already! Excited for this and while it‚Äôs a free to read GitBook right now, I hope it ends with some kind of physical manifestation.

At the KubeCon EU 2022 conference in Valencia, security researchers from Palo Alto Networks presented research findings on ‚Äútrampoline pods‚Äù‚Äîpods with an elevated set of privileges required to do their job, but that could conceivably be used as a jumping off point to gain escalated privileges.
The research mentions GKE, including how developers should look at the privileged pod problem today, what the GKE team is doing to minimize the use of privileged pods, and actions GKE users can take to protect their clusters.
Privileged pods within the context of GKE security

While privileged pods can pose a security issue, it‚Äôs important to look at them within the overall context of GKE security. To use a privileged pod as a ‚Äútrampoline‚Äù in GKE, ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I had the honor of joining Robby Russell (who you may remember from Oh My Zsh) on his Maintainable podcast for a super-fun discussion on well-maintained software. Here‚Äôs how Robby describes it:
Robby has a chat with Jerod Santo, the Managing Editor and Partner of Changelog Media. Jerod helps lead and co-host Changelog‚Äôs flagship podcast, The Changelog, and builds all the cool stuff that makes Changelog awesome. Jerod shares his journey from being a typical networking engineer (Infosec) to the experienced programmer that he is today and his programming wisdom from the trenches.
Tune in as he highlights the undeniable importance of automated test suites and code readability, describes the arc of an engineer‚Äôs career, and talks about the past experiences that make him lean more towards clarity over cleverness when coding. He also shares some of the things engineers should consider in regard to pulling in third-party code or writing from scratch, and so much more. Enjoy!
Thanks for having me, Robby! üíö

                    <span>James Simone ponders the relationship between healthy teams and performance in the software world.
Here‚Äôs what it comes down to: teams perform well when successes are shared and failures are owned‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt celebrate successes enough, and part of that (I think) is caused by the feeling of pressure that comes from working on a project that seems dooomed to fail without meticulous and ever-present attention.
He goes on to delve in to the source(s) of engineering failures, the dangers of ‚Äúbrightsizing‚Äù, known predictors for project success, and a bunch of related topics. Lots to ponder here alongside James, who‚Äôs seen a lot of software projects live &amp; die during his eight years in the business.

                    <span>WANT!
Framework has created a really slick, fully user serviceable, laptop and have recently started selling the mainboard as a SBC for general use.  To better support folks who may want to integrate it into their projects, they are also releasing technical documentation including  pinouts, cad models and other resources.
When they reached out and explained their plans and offered to let me play with one, I jumped at the chance and this is what I came up with after some experimentation.

                    <span>Another entry in the maintenance series! Throughout the series we‚Äôve discussed building versus buying, building actually maintainable software, maintaining ourselves, open source maintenance, legacy code, and most recently Go project structure. In this 7th installment of the series, we continue narrowing our focus by talking about what to do when projects get big and messy.

Over the next few months, we‚Äôll be completing the OpenJS Foundation‚Äôs incubation program checklist, including transferring the Jest domain, repo, website, and other assets to OpenJS. We‚Äôll also be updating the code of conduct and contributor license agreement.
Additionally, as part of this move, we will be publishing a project charter and creating new governance policies that will document the process for gaining commit access, as well as our leadership selection process.

                    <span>Firefox uses a multi-process model for additional security and stability while browsing: Web Content (such as HTML/CSS and Javascript) is rendered in separate processes that are isolated from the rest of the operating system and managed by a privileged parent process. This way, the amount of control gained by an attacker that exploits a bug in a content process is limited. In this article, we would like to dive a bit further into the latest major milestone we have reached: Win32k Lockdown, which greatly reduces the capabilities of the content process when running on Windows.

Nearly 24 years ago, Google started with two graduate students, one product, and a big mission: to organize the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accessible and useful. In the decades since, we‚Äôve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission.
The progress we&#x27;ve made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year ‚Äî on my favorite day of the year :) ‚Äî we share an update on how it‚Äôs going at Google I/O.
Today, I talked about how we‚Äôre advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission ‚Äî knowledge and computing ‚Äî to create products that are built to help. It‚Äôs exciting to build these products; it‚Äôs even more exciting to see what people do with them.

                    <span>I love when software engineers share their career/life choices and the reasoning behind them so others can benefit from their perspective, like this one on bucket filling:
Somebody once described balance to me as three buckets filled with water. One for career, a second for physical health, and a third for social and family life. At any point, one bucket might be running low. But as long as the overall water level is high enough, things should be fine.
Scott‚Äôs choice to join a startup seems odd given his reason for leaving Google, but:
So: am I happier? Undoubtedly yes.
I work more hours. I‚Äôm more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now. But what I do makes a difference that I can see. Progress feels 10x faster.
Most surprising is that I have more energy. It‚Äôs easier to find motivation to get back in the gym. I have more energy in social situations.
Working more hours sounds like tipping the work/life balance in the wrong direction, but excitement about your work certainly changes the calculus. He‚Äôs happier now, so that‚Äôs great!

Every year, security technologies improve: browsers get better, encryption becomes ubiquitous on the Web, authentication becomes stronger. But phishing persistently remains a threat (as shown by a recent phishing attack on the U.S. Department of Labor) because users retain the ability to log into their online accounts, often with a simple password, from anywhere in the world. It‚Äôs why today at I/O we announced new ways we‚Äôre reducing the risks of phishing by: scaling phishing protections to Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, continuing to auto enroll people in 2-Step Verification and more. This blog will deep dive into the method of phishing and how it has evolved today.

                    <span>This week Sid Sijbrandij Co-founder and CEO of GitLab is back talking with Adam about all the details of their massive IPO last October 2021. To set the stage, this episode was recorded on Feb 1, 2022. During the show Adam mentioned they IPO‚Äôd at a $13B market cap, but they actually ended their opening day at approximately $15B. That‚Äôs a massive win for open source, GitLab, Sid, and the rest of the team. For loyal listeners you know we‚Äôve had Sid on this show before, so of course we had to get him back on the show post-IPO to get all the details of this new journey.

rename headers|links inside Markdown (and propagate the changes)
rename Markdown files (and propagate to all references)
The Dendron team is excited because their primary vault hosts over 400k lines of Markdown ü§Ø
VS Code, and IDEs more broadly, help developers manage large code bases by making available tools to leverage and manipulate the syntax of programming languages. By shifting some of this tooling to markdown, can we do the same for large Markdown repositories?

                    <span>I‚Äôve long been fascinated by literate programming (the art of writing code as if it was a novel), but it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve seen a good example of in practice. Here‚Äôs a good one:
I wanted to showcase the BDD-inspired low-tech solution I came up with via a toy project, demonstrating a small but significant programming task, broken down as series of design-implementation cycles.
Wordle is a perfect target: it‚Äôs a small codebase, with a half dozen features to string together into a useable game.
This story has five chapters and a satisfying conclusion:
This project was my first foray into literate programming at this scale, an attempt to bring together all the good ideas of TDD, modern Python development, Gherkin usage for requirements traceability purposes (without overly zealous extremes of Cucumber automation). All these ideas were until now scattered, implemented each without the others in different places, and this project fuses them into something I hope is more valuable than the sum of its parts.

Woody leads Mob Programming workshops, he‚Äôs a speaker on agile related topics, and coaches and guides orgs interested in creating an environment where people can do their best work. We talk through it all and we even get some amazing advice from Woody‚Äôs dad. We define what Mob Programming is and why it‚Äôs so effective. Is it a rigid process or can teams flex to make it work for them? How to introduce mob programming to a team. What kind of groundwork is necessary? And of course, are mob programming‚Äôs virtues diminished by remote teams in virtual-only settings?

                    <span>Andra≈æ Bajt:
Basic premise is: browsers are great at navigating pages, let‚Äôs leverage that by serving users directly with HTML. This already gives you half-decent pages but you can go further and sprinkle on some sugar. A bit of JS. Instead of reinventing the world in JS let‚Äôs try to really use what modern browsers provide natively and then push just a bit forward.
Is the pendulum starting to swing away from SPAs/client-side rendering and back toward MPAs/server-side rendering? Will we ever find balance somewhere in the middle?

The software supply chain starts with the developer. Developer accounts are frequent targets for social engineering and account takeover, and protecting developers from these types of attacks is the first and most critical step toward securing the supply chain‚Ä¶
Today, as part of a platform-wide effort to secure the software ecosystem through improving account security, we‚Äôre announcing that GitHub will require all users who contribute code on GitHub.com to enable one or more forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) by the end of 2023.
This is a big step in the right direction and their new(ish) 2FA for GitHub Mobile feature helps make the burden not as cumbersome as it might be otherwise.

I was working on bioinformatics a few years ago and was amazed by those single-word bash commands which are much faster than my dull scripts, time saved through learning command-line shortcuts and scripting.
Recent years I am working on cloud computing and I keep recording those useful commands here. Not all of them is oneliner, but I put effort on making them brief and swift. I am mainly using Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, RedHat, Linux Mint, Mac and CentOS, sorry if the commands don‚Äôt work on your system.

                    <span>Today we talk to Mark Ericksen about all the things that we could be doing on the new platform - this is a follow-up to episode 50.
Mark specialises in Elixir, he hosts the Thinking Elixir podcast, and he also helps make Fly.io the best place to run Phoenix apps, such as changelog.com. In the interest of holding our new platform right, we thought that it would be a great idea to talk to someone that does this all day, every day, for many years now.
We touch up on how to run database migrations safely, and how to upgrade our application config to the latest Phoenix version. We also talked about some of the more advanced platform features that we may want to start leveraging, like the multi-region PostgreSQL.

                    <span>The coolest thing about this story is that the entire endeavor was apparently prompted by a random developer tweet! If you‚Äôve ever wondered what all goes in to opening the source of historic software products like this one:
This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.
Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the original release who consented to keeping their names in place
The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and have been excluded
The code does not build with today‚Äôs engineering tools, and is released as-is.

You‚Äôll learn about a cool compiler optimization called ‚Äústring interning‚Äù, which is used in many languages. Also, you will understand what happens when (almost any) interpreter runs your code, take a look at the AST and take a peak at the symbols interpretation at the low level.

                    <span>Since TypeScript doesn‚Äôt follow SemVer itself, TS libraries which do want to follow SemVer need both high-level guidance about how to do that and detailed analysis of the corner cases to watch out for as well as ways to mitigate breaking changes from TS.
This doc is a (beta!) specification of SemVer for managing changes to TypeScript types, including when the TS compiler makes breaking changes in its type-checking and type emit across a ‚Äúminor‚Äù release.

                    <span>Spacedrive helps you organize your files across many devices in one place. Here‚Äôs the motivation:
Many of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren‚Äôt backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn‚Äôt be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us‚Äîopen source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.

                    <span>This is alpha software, but it seems pretty low risk to give it a try.
Wireit works with npm run, it doesn‚Äôt replace it. To configure an NPM script for Wireit, move the command into a new wireit section of your package.json, and replace the original script with the wireit command.
Now when you run npm run build, Wireit upgrades the script to be smarter and more efficient.

We are entering a new world with a new focus on giving users control over their data, their identity, and their systems. We are building distributed filesystems, distributed identity, and yes, blockchains. I think oftentimes we end up seeing only the blockchain technology due to the headlines and the financial investment, but distributed systems as a whole are taking off in a big, big way.

                    <span>The second jq alternative we‚Äôve discovered this week! (first here)
jq is hard to use. There are alternatives like fq and zq, but they still make you learn a new programming language. Im tired of learning new programming languages.
gq is not optimized for speed, flexibility or beauty. gq is optimized for minimal learning/quick usage. gq understands that you don‚Äôt use it constantly, you use it once a month and then forget about it. So when you come back to it, gq will be easy to relearn. Just use the builtin library just like you would any other go project and you‚Äôre done. No unfamiliar syntax or operations, or surprising limits. Thats it.
I don‚Äôt know if Go is a great fit for this use-case, but if you already know it well‚Ä¶ makes sense.

Despite open source software‚Äôs essential role in all software built today, it‚Äôs far too easy for bad actors to circulate malicious packages that attack the systems and users running that software. Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute. As a result, malicious packages like ua-parser-js, and node-ipc are regularly uploaded to popular repositories despite their best efforts, with sometimes devastating consequences for users.

                    <span>The latest Common Voice dataset, released today, has achieved a major milestone: More than 20,000 hours of open-source speech data that anyone, anywhere can use. The dataset has nearly doubled in the past year. Mozilla‚Äôs Common Voice seeks to change the language technology ecosystem by supporting communities to collect voice data for the creation of voice-enabled applications for their own languages.

After migrating all our media files to AWS S3 (check episode 40), we thought that this part was going to be easy. Plan met reality. Pull request 407 has all the details.
We want to emphasise the type of partner relationships that we seek at Changelog &amp; why they are important to us, as well as to our listeners. Honeycomb &amp; Fly embody the principles that we care about, and Gerhard thinks that we are currently missing a Kubernetes partner.

We will cover zq‚Äôs performance in a future article, but to cut to the chase here, zq is almost always at least a bit faster than jq when processing JSON inputs
Almost always at least a bit faster is not something you‚Äôre likely to notice in practice.

Some of his grievances like window snapping and moving/removing UI elements can be alleviated with 3rd-party solutions, but he‚Äôs not wrong that the operating system doesn‚Äôt provide these features.

Providing a safe experience to billions of users continues to be one of the highest priorities for Google Play. Last year we introduced multiple privacy focused features, enhanced our protections against bad apps and developers, and improved SDK data safety. In addition, Google Play Protect continues to scan billions of installed apps each day across billions of devices to keep people safe from malware and unwanted software.  
  
We continue to enhance our machine learning systems and review processes, and in 2021 we blocked 1.2 million policy violating apps from being published on Google Play, preventing billions of harmful installations.
