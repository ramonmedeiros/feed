                    <span>Running live demos can be stressful. You know what you want to say and show. You prepare the CLI commands you want to run to best showcase what you’ve built, but then you waste time typing long commands; you make typos; the commands fail or take way too long to complete. Maybe they depend on external system (network, APIs, cloud, …) and of course it’s not cooperating while you’re running your live demo.
Here’s how you can avoid all of the above by scripting, automating and recording your demos, so that you never have to stress about showcasing ever again…

few  patches that completely removed XUL layout from the Firefox codebase.


 This means that (modulo a few exceptions documented below) all the Firefox UI is using regular web technology to render (mostly CSS flexbox).


 This was a rather big effort (first filed 9 years ago in bug 1033225), and I wanted to document some of the things that I learned during the process, some of the things and decisions that made it possible, and some of the things that I would’ve maybe done differently.

GitHub private repos lull us into lazy thinking.
We cram our secrets into git, then shove it off to the most expansive code forge in the history of humanity, and most of the time: everything’s fine.
But GitHub’s ssh host key leak last week demonstrates that private repos are, at best, private-ish.

                    <span>Alex Schepanovski:
I always thought of 1+N as a thing that you just keep in your head, catch on code reviews or via performance regressions. This worked well for a long time, however, the less control we have over our SQL queries the more likely it will sneak through those guards…
I tumbled on a couple of 1+Ns while reading a project code for an unrelated reason and it got me thinking – do I ever want Django to do that lazy loading stuff? And the answer was never.
Turns out the implementation of this is quite easy. ~15 loc for the naive version and ~35 for a more robust version. Give it a try if you, like Alex, never want to allow a 1+N in your Django app again.

                    <span>This open letter by the Future of Life institute has been signed by 1380 people (so far) including notable technologists such as Steve Wozniak, Stuart Russell, Emad Mostaque (Stability AI) &amp; Elon Musk.
Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that “At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.” We agree. That point is now.
Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.

                    <span>In 2011 I started to send “pre-notifications” about pending curl security vulnerabilities to the distros mailing list (back then it was still called linux-distros). For several years we also asked them for CVE IDs for the new vulnerabilities that we were about to publish to the world. By notifying the distros ahead of time, the … Continue reading Pre-notification dilemmas →</span>

                    <span>We are seeing an explosion of AI apps that are (at their core) a thin UI on top of calls to OpenAI generative models. What risks are associated with this sort of approach to AI integration, and is explainability and accountability something that can be achieved in chat-based assistants?
Beth Rudden of Bast.ai has been thinking about this topic for some time and has developed an ontological approach to creating conversational AI. We hear more about that approach and related work in this episode.

                    <span>ALOHA stands for “A Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation”, which is certainly a stretch in terms of acronym, but the project itself is so cool that I don’t think it really matters… Here’s the pitch:
Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface.

                    <span>Dave Runje:
We were searching for something like FastAPI for Kafka-based service we were developing, but couldn’t find anything similar. So we shamelessly made one by reusing beloved paradigms from FastAPI and we shamelessly named it FastKafka.
The point was to set the expectations right - you get pretty much what you would expect: function decorators for consumers and producers with type hints specifying Pydantic classes for JSON encoding/decoding, automatic message routing to Kafka brokers and documentation generation.

It’s a typing app specifically for software developers. You type code snippets from real open source projects. It supports inviting your friends to a room and competing in real time against your friends, and you can get your result on the global leaderboard.
I like how it uses code snippets from popular projects. I don’t like how slow I am at writing Rust code! 🤣

                    <span>Steve Yegge is very excited about LLMs and thinks the rest of us should be as well:
There is something legendary and historic happening in software engineering, right now as we speak, and yet most of you don’t realize at all how big it is.
LLMs aren’t just the biggest change since social, mobile, or cloud–they’re the biggest thing since the World Wide Web. And on the coding front, they’re the biggest thing since IDEs and Stack Overflow, and may well eclipse them both.
Steve’s been in the industry a long time. He worked at Amazon back when AWS was just a demo on some engineer’s laptop and he worked at Google when Kubernetes was just a demo on some engineer’s laptop.
The point: when Steve Yegge gets excited about something it probably means more than when most people get excited about something.

We were just discussing Apple’s next AI move on yesterday’s JS Party live (ships to the feed next Friday). They’ve been the quietest tech giant since the GenAI movement kicked in to high gear. My guess: they’ll have a LOT to say at this June’s WWDC…

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Georgi Gerganov about his work on Whisper.cpp and llama.cpp. Georgi first crossed our radar with whisper.cpp, his port of OpenAI’s Whisper model in C and C++. Whisper is a speech recognition model enabling audio transcription and translation. Something we’re paying close attention to here at Changelog, for obvious reasons. Between the invite and the show’s recording, he had a new hit project on his hands: llama.cpp. This is a port of Facebook’s LLaMA model in C and C++. Whisper.cpp made a splash, but llama.cpp is growing in GitHub stars faster than Stable Diffusion did, which was a rocket ship itself.

fzf is a bit of a weird program because installing it actually overwrites a whole bunch of keyboard shortcuts, in the interest of making them better. Normally I would hate this. But…
Lots of good stuff in this post 👍

                    <span>Josh Comeau:
Over the past few months, I’ve spoken with lots of early-career devs who are getting more and more anxious about AI. They’ve seen the increasingly-impressive demos from tools like GPT-4, and they worry that by the time they’re fluent in HTML/CSS/JS, there won’t be any jobs left for them.
I couldn’t disagree more. I don’t think web developer jobs are going anywhere. And I’m getting pretty sick of the FUD? being spread online.
So, in this blog post, I’m going to share my hypothesis for what will happen. Things are going to change, but not in the scary way people are saying.

                    <span>Nowadays, Alpine Linux is one of the most popular options for container base images. Many people (maybe including you) use it for anything and everything. Some people use it because of its small size, some because of habit and some, just because they copy-pasted a Dockerfile from some tutorial. Yet, there are plenty of reasons why you should not use Alpine for your container images, some of which can cause you great amount of grief…

                    <span>Docker CMO, Tim Anglade:
For those of you catching up, we recently emailed accounts that are members of Free Team organizations, to let them know that they will lose features unless they move to one of our supported free or paid offerings. This impacted less than 2% of our users…
The Docker Free Team subscription was deprecated in part because it was poorly targeted. In particular, it didn’t serve the open source audience as well as our recently updated Docker-Sponsored Open Source program, the latter offering benefits that exceed those of the deprecated Free Team plan.
We’d also like to clarify that public images will only be removed from Docker Hub if their maintainer decides to delete them. We’re sorry that our initial communications failed to make this clear.
Just to be clear: their apology is not about the change, it’s about how they communicated the change. There’s more details in the post about deleting public images, squatting names, etc, but that’s the gist.

This release brings many new features, while aiming to make TypeScript smaller, simpler, and faster. We’ve implemented the new decorators standard, added functionality to better support ESM projects in Node and bundlers, provided new ways for library authors to control generic inference, expanded our JSDoc functionality, simplified configuration, and made many other improvements.

The new React site (react.dev) teaches modern React with function components and Hooks.
We’ve included diagrams, illustrations, challenges, and over 600 new interactive examples.
The previous React documentation site has now moved to legacy.reactjs.org.

                    <span>Alex Ellis:
Yesterday, Docker sent an email to any Docker Hub user who had created an “organisation”, telling them their account will be deleted including all images, if they do not upgrade to a paid team plan. The email contained a link to a tersely written PDF (since, silently edited) which was missing many important details which caused significant anxiety and additional work for open source maintainers.
He goes on to explain the problem in great details. Btw, Alex is no Docker hater. He has a long history of using and supporting the tech. He goes on to say:
Open Source has a funding problem, and Docker was born in Open Source. We the community were their king makers, and now that they’re turning over significant revenue, they are only too ready to forget their roots.
This decision seems myopic. There are other image hosting options, one of them even shares (inspired?) half of DockerHub’s name… Oh, and here’s our open invitation to the folks at Docker to come on the pod.

                    <span>Justin Searls dives deep into whether AI tools like ChatGPT actually threaten knowledge worker jobs and provides helpful ideas around what to do about it.
Having spent months programming with GitHub Copilot, weeks talking to ChatGPT, and days searching via Bing Chat as an alternative to Google, the best description I’ve heard of AI’s capabilities is “fluent bullshit.” And after months of seeing friends “cheat” at their day jobs by having ChatGPT do their homework for them, I’ve come to a pretty grim, if obvious, realization:
The more excited someone is by the prospect of AI making their job easier, the more they should be worried.

someone is going to abuse your site
you need a performance monitoring system
your SQL queries need to be optimized
your users might have genius ideas

                    <span>Another win for the fediverse. Plugin developer Matthias Pfefferle (who is joining WordPress with the acquisition):
When Matt announced that Tumblr wants to implement ActivityPub on Twitter, I asked why not WordPress, so I came in contact with Automattic and they offered me the opportunity to work full time on the plugin and other Open Web projects.
The plugin lets people follow your WordPress site on ActivityPub-supporting social networks. Today it has over 2k active installs, but what would that number look like if this plugin came bundled with new installs/upgrades?
There’s very little downside for WordPress site owners to one-click install that sucker…

                    <span>A multi-tenant HTTP reverse tunnel solution through remote port forwarding from the SSH protocol.
This is intended for small teams that need to expose the local development environment to the public internet, and you need to bring your own domain name and SSO provider.
It gives stable subdomain for every user, and gated by your SSO through OIDC protocol.
Think this as a bare-bone alternative to the ngrok’s $65/user/month enterprise tier. Try to put this behind a production system will blow up your SLA.
For individuals and production systems, just buy ngrok, it is still my favorite.

I heard Paul Ford, a professional writer for Wired and other publications, say something on The Aboard Podcast, Episode 3 that resonated. Referring to a moment when lots of folks online were looking for the perfect writing environment, he said the software tool, workflow, environment, whatever, it didn’t matter. You could do it with pen and paper if you want.
The only technology that you need is deadlines.
Ooff. Yup, that resonates. That’s been the best piece of technology for making me productive too.
See also arbitrary deadlines are actually awesome by yours truly.

                    <span>This week Adam talks with Marcin Kurc about chasing the 9s. Marcin is the Co-founder and CEO of Nobl9 where they build tools for managing service level objectives, aka SLOs. We also talk about service level agreements (SLAs), service level indicators (SLIs), error budgets, and monitoring, and how it all comes together to help teams align on goals, improve customer satisfaction, manage risks, increase transparency, and of course, a favorite around here…continuous improvement. Kaizen! This is an awesome deep dive into the world of chasing those 9s, and how teams are levering SLOs to earn the trust of their customers as well showcase transparency.

Super powerful? I think so. Super risky?! Likely, especially if a lot of your data-related logic is in app code. Worth it? That’s up to you to decide…

It is an interesting time for everyone concerned with open source vulnerabilities. The U.S. Executive Order on Improving the Nation&#x27;s Cybersecurity requirements for vulnerability disclosure programs and assurances for software used by the US government will go into effect later this year. Finding and fixing security vulnerabilities has never been more important, yet with increasing interest in the area, the vulnerability management space has become fragmented—there are a lot of new tools and competing standards. 
In 2021, we announced the launch of OSV, a database of open source vulnerabilities built partially from vulnerabilities found through Google’s OSS-Fuzz program. OSV has grown since then and now includes a…</span>

Starting in Chrome 111 we will begin to turn down the Chrome Cleanup Tool, an application distributed to Chrome users on Windows to help find and remove unwanted software (UwS). 
Origin story
  
The Chrome Cleanup Tool was introduced in 2015 to help users recover from unexpected settings changes, and to detect and remove unwanted software. To date, it has performed more than 80 million cleanups, helping to pave the way for a cleaner, safer web. 
A changing landscape
  
In recent years, several factors have led us to reevaluate the need for this application to keep Chrome users on Windows safe.  
First, the user perspective – Chrome user complaints about UwS have continued to fall over the years, averaging out to around 3% of total complaints in…</span>

                    <span>We’ve all experienced pain moving from local development, to testing, and then on to production. This cycle can be long and tedious, especially as AI models and datasets are integrated. Modal is trying to make this loop of development as seamless as possible for AI practitioners, and their platform is pretty incredible!
Erik from Modal joins us in this episode to help us understand how we can run or deploy machine learning models, massively parallel compute jobs, task queues, web apps, and much more, without our own infrastructure.

                    <span>Service Weaver is a programming framework for writing, deploying, and managing distributed applications in Go. With Service Weaver, you write your application like it is a traditional, single-process Go executable that runs on your local machine. Then, you deploy it to the Cloud, and the framework breaks it down into a set of connected microservices and integrates it with the cloud provider (e.g., monitoring, tracing, logging).

                    <span>Hired CEO, Josh Brenner:
We create this report every year to help talent professionals and software engineers understand the hiring climate, as well as what’s top of mind for employers and engineers.
Here’s some of their key findings:
Attracted to the field by new challenges and continuous learning, software engineers remain optimistic about the future.
Layoffs (from May to December 2022) had the greatest impact on salaries and interview interest for junior and non-traditional engineers.
Despite high-profile calls for return-to-office (RTO), demand for remote engineering talent remains high. Remote roles command higher salaries than local roles, especially in smaller markets.
The most in-demand coding skills and software engineering roles shifted this year.
There’s a lot to digest here. Worth a read, especially if you’re on the market.
