                    <span>Often software developers are encouraged to learn deeply. Know your language and framework of choice better. That’s all good, but there’s another side to learning that’s often overlooked. Knowing a little about a lot of things so you have less blind spots.
In the blog post we look at the importance of learning broadly and how to go about it.

                    <span>Property-based testing helps us write better tests, with less code, and greater coverage. This leads to more confidence in our code, and fewer bugs in our applications. But, as always, there’s a price. Property tests take more effort to write, and they take longer to run. But they’re worth it.

                    <span>Doug Turnbull breaks down a major difference between two beloved programming languages in how they handle iteration.
Python embraces for. Objects tell for how to work with them, and the for loop’s body processes what’s given back by the object. Ruby does the opposite. In Ruby, for itself (via each) is a method of the Object. The caller passes the body of the for loop to this method.
He goes on to give examples and explain why each approach might map to different developers’ brains… differently. Here’s a succinct summary, if you don’t have time for the deeper discussion:
In Ruby, the objects control the affordances. In Python, the language does.

                    <span>TIL Apple added a networkQuality utility to Monterey which measures the quality of your device’s internet connection much like speedtest.net and fast.com.
λ networkQuality
&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; SUMMARY &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
Upload capacity: 14.696 Mbps
Download capacity: 21.661 Mbps
Upload flows: 20
Download flows: 12
Responsiveness: Low (103 RPM)

What’s interesting about it is that it measures your upload and download in parallel by default, which is more aligned with real-world usage than running them back-to-back like other tests do.

                    <span>What was I doing the last time I was here?
We’re linking to the repo, but the idea is where it’s at. The code is a one-liner (if you’re using zsh)
grep -v &quot;jog&quot; ~/.zsh_history_ext | grep -a --color&#x3D;never &quot;${PWD}   &quot; | cut -f1 -d&quot;|&quot; | tail

Then you add this to your .zshrc
function zshaddhistory() {
	echo &quot;${1%%$&#x27;\n&#x27;}|${PWD}   &quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zsh_history_ext
}

Now you’re all set for the next time you need to jog your memory!

                    <span>Sound career &amp;&amp; life advice by Adam Keys:
It’s possibly the best advice for managers I’ve given so far. When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!
I have to remind myself of this when I’m rushing. It’s faster to ping someone to arrange a synchronous talk than it is to write out what I need to say and cover all the bases. But that doesn’t give me license to skip all the context. Broad strokes are okay. An information vacuum is not okay.
Hmm I probably have to work on this one…

It all started with Oleg’s tweet back in July, in which he was promoting Akihiro Kiuchi’s work on Jenkins monitoring with OpenTelemetry. This was done in the context of Google’s Summer of Code - a link to Akihiro’s demo is in the show notes.
As you may remember from episode 20, instrumenting our changelog.com pipeline is on Gerhard’s mind, and this conversation helped him clarify a few things. If you are thinking of instrumenting your CI/CD pipeline with OpenTelemetry, this episode is for you.

                    <span>Svyatoslav Kryukov on the Evil Martian blog:
Ruby is awesome. We love its readability, flexibility, and developer-centric nature. Still, here at Mars, we also love Go because it has its own sense of simplicity and magic, too. Simply put, Go holds advantages over Ruby in some aspects: it’s faster, statically typed, and comes with cool concurrency primitives out of the box. This being said, some intrepid readers might find themselves grappling with a seemingly reasonable question: if Go is so darn good, why don’t we just write everything with it?
Read this tale and learn to write Go in Ruby, gaining the ability to modify Ruby exactly as you desire.

In recent years, continuous fuzzing has become an essential part of the software development lifecycle. By feeding unexpected or random data into a program, fuzzing catches bugs that would otherwise slip through the most thorough manual checks and provides coverage that would take staggering human effort to replicate. NIST’s guidelines for software verification, recently released in response to the White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, specify fuzzing among the minimum standard requirements for code verification.
Today, we are excited to announce ClusterFuzzLite, a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before. With just a few line…</span>

                    <span>Each year we discuss the latest insights from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), and this year is no different.  Daniel and Chris delve into key findings and discuss in this Fully-Connected episode.  They also check out a study called ‘Delphi: Towards Machine Ethics and Norms’, about how to integrate ethics and morals into AI models.

                    <span>NGINX can do a lot. But configuring it to do various things can be tedious. Enter Digital Ocean’s NGINXConfig project:
You can deep dive into the NGINX documentation right now OR you can use this tool to check how NGINX works, observe how your inputs are affecting the output, and generate the best config for your specific use-case (in parallel you can also still use the docs).

                    <span>In 2018 we began our flood forecasting initiative to help combat the catastrophic damage from floods each year by equipping those in harm’s way with accurate and detailed alerts. This work is a part of Google’s broader Crisis Response program which provides people access to trusted information and resources in critical moments. For over a decade, our Crisis Response team has been partnering with front line and emergency workers to develop technology and programs that help keep people safe, informed and out of harm’s way.

Expanding our forecasting reach
In the first three years, we expanded our program to cover much of India and Bangladesh, working in partnership with the Indian Central Water Commision and with the Bangladesh Water Development Board, covering an area with about 220 million…</span>

Today, we’re inviting an initial group of people to test Project Relate, a new Android app that aims to help people with speech impairments communicate more easily with others and interact with the Google Assistant.
Project Relate is a continuation of years of research from both Google’s Speech and Research teams, made possible by over a million speech samples recorded by participants of our research effort. We are now looking for English-speaking testers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States to try out the app and provide feedback to help us improve it.

                    <span>Eric Gregory asks (and answers) himself a question on The New Stack:
For years now, blogs, webinars and white papers have opined that GitOps is the Next Big Thing, yet here a respected voice in the field is saying to tread carefully. So what gives? Do we need to pump the brakes? Is GitOps just a lot of unwarranted hype? Or is there a missing piece of the puzzle here? As in so many things, the answer is: It’s complicated. GitOps can be transformative for some teams, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.

                    <span>Avdi Grimm kicks off a new series of posts (that I’m quite excited about) on the various parts that go into a “banana stand” business by deftly wielding a classic Arrested Development gag and telling the tale of how he got his stand started:
I’m a software developer by trade. I’ve slung code either as an employee or as an independent consultant for over two decades. But around ten years ago, I started selling e-books about programming. At the time it was a way to recoup the time and energy I had sunk into researching conference talks, as well as a way to expand on the topics of those talks.
E-books expanded to screencasts, and then to courses. I found myself with a diversified product income that sometimes rivaled or even exceeded what I could expect from a developer’s salary.
As a result, gaps between gigs haven’t felt like “unemployment” for a long time. Instead, they are opportunities to work on my education business. Recently, a major gig I’d been looking forward to fell through at the last second. Once I worked through the disappointment, I was like: “welp, there’s always money in the banana stand!”
The first component of your banana stand: a mailing list

                    <span>This is the first time I’ve heard of a reverse dictionary, but now that I have… so cool!
Opposite to a regular (forward) dictionary that provides definitions for query words, a reverse dictionary returns words semantically matching the query descriptions.
Ever had a word on the tip of your tongue and you Just. Can’t. Think of it?! Reverse dictionary!

                    <span>This is a great post byu Andy Kimball on what they mean when they say CockroachDB is now serverless:
Serverless means you don’t have to think about servers. Of course there are servers hard at work handling your application’s requests, but that’s our problem, not yours. We do all the hard work behind the scenes of allocating, configuring, and maintaining the servers. Instead of paying for servers, you pay for the requests that your application makes to the database and the storage that your data consumes.
How they got here:
Before now, a single physical CockroachDB cluster was intended for dedicated use by a single user or organization. That is called single-tenancy. Over the past several CockroachDB releases, we’ve quietly been adding multi-tenancy support…
How they scale it:
Within every Serverless cluster, there is an autoscaler component that is responsible for determining the ideal number of SQL pods that should be assigned to each tenant, whether that be one, many, or zero.
And what it all means for Cockroach’s users.

                    <span>Rachel by the Bay:
There’s a post going around tonight about how someone forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full table scans (or something like that). The rub is that instead of just being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy vendor system charged by the row or somesuch. So, by scanning the whole table, they touched all of those rows, and oh hey, massive amounts of money just set ablaze!
The usual venues are discussing it, and I get the impression some people have the wrong approach to this. I want to describe a truly bad database schema I encountered, and then tell you a little about what it did to the system performance.
A fun story with an excellent twist at the end.

One of mine around coding goes back to college in the 70s. I learned about parsing arithmetic expressions and putting them into Reverse Polish notation. And then, I figured out that, just like multiplication is repeated addition, division is repeated subtraction.

                    <span>Brian Di Croce writes a few thousand words saying SLOW DOWN in different ways. And it’s good!
Don’t race yourself to a burnout or a weaker desire to work in this creative field. Slow down. Know what you’re doing before you start typing the first line of code. Make sure that you understand what needs to be built. If what needs to be built isn’t 100% sure by anyone, then accept the reality that it might have to be built incrementally. It’s not the ideal, but sometimes it’s real.
If you’ll allow me to pick one nit with this post: successful software is rarely finished. And if you’re making successful software you likely won’t finish either. So, I would suggest wording this slightly different: Slow down to go faster 😉

                    <span>Each year a group of user researchers and the Go team get together and create a survey for the Go community. The results of the survey are analyzed and turned into a report made available to everyone in the Go community. In this episode we sit down with Alice Merrick and Todd Kulesza to discuss the survey, how it’s made, and some of the interesting results from this year’s survey.

                    <span>This is a short post by long-time open source maintainer Chris Manson about commitment to tasks in the open source world and how life always takes priority over dev.
We always need to keep in mind that most open source contributions are given from people that are opting to give up their spare time (usually for free) and the level of expectation can never come anywhere close to the sort of relationship that an employer might have with an employee or contractor.

This morning, I shared the following post with Hubbers in response to Nat’s announcement about his next adventure. I am thrilled to take on the role of CEO to build the next phase of GitHub for our global community of software developers.
Exiting as CEO, Nat Friedman shared his thanks in a post titled “Thank you, GitHub”.
This morning, I sent the following post to the GitHub team. TL;DR: I’m moving on to my next adventure, and Thomas Dohmke (currently Chief Product Officer) will be GitHub’s next CEO. I will become Chairman Emeritus, which fulfills my lifelong ambition of having a title in Latin. My heartfelt thanks to every Hubber and every developer who makes GitHub what it is, every day.

                    <span>Two up-and-coming database options compared:
Recently, TimescaleDB published a blog comparing ClickHouse &amp; TimescaleDB using timescale/tsbs, a timeseries benchmarking framework. I have some experience with PostgreSQL and ClickHouse but never got the chance to play with TimescaleDB. Some of the claims about TimescaleDB made in their post are very bold, that made me even more curious. I thought it’d be a great opportunity to try it out and see if those claims are really true.

                    <span>The team’s goal is to become “the de-facto open-source alternative to MongoDB.” Here’s why:
MongoDB is a life-changing technology for many developers, empowering them to build applications faster than using relational databases. Its easy-to-use and well-documented drivers make MongoDB one of the easiest to use database solutions available. However, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots, changing the license to SSPL - making it unusable for many open source and commercial projects.
Most MongoDB users are not in need of many of the advanced features offered by MongoDB; however, they are in need of an open-source database solution. Recognizing this, MangoDB is here to fill the gap by providing an alternative.
This is currently a proof of concept. The concept: a proxy that converts Mongo’s wire protocol to SQL and stores everything in PostgreSQL. Fascinating idea! Will it work?

                    <span>The linked post is about a new book by Jeremy Wagner, but I just wanted to highlight the excellent aside on book writing by Chris Coyier near the end:
Write a blog post first, or maybe a whole bunch of blog posts. That’ll prove you clearly have words to say about this. Plus it will get the energy of your idea into the world. You might get feedback and constructive insights on the idea as it is shared. Then, hopefully, you can turn that blog post into a talk. That’ll really get you thinking deeply about your idea while getting even more comfortable with the idea of sharing it clearly. And, if all goes well, turn all of that into a book!
Looks like Jeremy did just that.

Here’s a question: how can we see what’s happening inside an arbitrary Go process? Or, more precisely, how can we see what all the goroutines are doing at any given moment? If we could crack that, it could help us figure out why they’re not processing our requests.

                    <span>We recently upgraded our monolith application from Rails 6.0 to Rails 6.1. By evaluating our prior experience on Rails upgrades, we have streamlined the process and we want to share it with you.
In this post we give some insights on our workflow, from organizing such a milestone to actually delivering it without blocking an engineering team of more than 160 developers, building an application that peaks at more than 100k requests per minute.

                    <span>Bug bounty program data tells a story—but which story?

Tracking program metrics can help organizations identify issues, spot opportunities, and take corrective actions. To do this, stakeholders must know which metrics to track and how to interpret the results.</span>

A lot of work goes into every release, and the short list of release notes generally doesn’t fully capture the wide range of improvements in the release. So in this new experimental format of release documentation, we hope to give a better picture of what will change with this release of openpilot.</span>

                    <span>Have you heard? The just-released 12th version of Next.js uses a Rust-based compiler (swc) to achieve ~3x faster local refreshes and ~5x faster production builds.
Compilation using Rust is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default using Next.js 12, replacing transforming JavaScript and TypeScript files. This meant we had to port the Babel transformations in Next.js to Rust, including a brand new CSS parser in Rust used to implement the styled-jsx transform.
With the increased popularity of Rust and Go-based JS tooling, could there be a future where we don’t use any JavaScript to build our JavaScript apps? 🤔

                    <span>This post by Pat Shaugnessy echoes Matt Rickard’s sentiment that we discussed in-depth on The Changelog 463:
The best way to learn a new programming language, just like a human language, is from example. To learn how to write code you first need to read someone else’s code. But who is the best person to learn from? Which code should we read? Where should we look to find it?
Pat was looking into Crystal and found its standard library to be excellent reading. I think his conclusion generalizes pretty well, with caveats.
Older languages often have areas of the standard library that were written prior to new language features, so they are no longer idiomatic.
Some standard library code is necessarily low-level, even dipping into the underlying language or using esoteric features. This can make for some tough sledding.
Standard library code is used so frequently that it’s often highly optimized for performance, which reduces readability.

                    <span>This essay from Mary Rose Cook explains how Git works. Who should read this? Anyone who wants a deeper understanding of Git.
The essay assumes you understand Git well enough to use it to version control your projects. It focuses on the graph structure that underpins Git and the way the properties of this graph dictate Git’s behavior. Looking at fundamentals, you build your mental model on the truth rather than on hypotheses constructed from evidence gathered while experimenting with the API. This truer model gives you a better understanding of what Git has done, what it is doing, and what it will do.

                    <span>Brandon Quakkelaar:
I am not a big social media guy anymore. Over the last few years I’ve been actively avoiding it. I’m not a fan of each platform’s privacy concerns, and users need to be very cautious to avoid flamewars and infinite doomscrolling. If we aren’t careful, social media’s default state seems to devolve into just destroying trust and goodwill. I prefer society in real life.
However, avoiding social media means that we lose a lot of interesting articles, funny memes, and informative videos that are shared on those platforms.
In case you haven’t guessed it, he goes on to prescribe RSS as the solution to this problem. I have a half-written blog post titled, “RSS is the indie social network we’ve been looking for”… so I tend to agree with him.

                    <span>When I reflect on the past two decades of computer science research, few things inspire me more than the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the field of artificial intelligence.


In 2001, some colleagues sitting just a few feet away from me at Google realized they could use an obscure technique called machine learning to help correct misspelled Search queries. (I remember I was amazed to see it work on everything from “ayambic pitnamiter” to “unnblevaiabel”). Today, AI augments many of the things that we do, whether that’s helping you capture a nice selfie, or providing more useful search results, or warning hundreds of millions of people when and where flooding will occur. Twenty years of advances in research have helped elevate AI from a promising idea to an indispensable aid in billions…</span>

                    <span>Today Adam is joined by Evan Kaplan, CEO of InfluxData. Evan’s journey to become the CEO was not by way of founder, in this company. Evan has founded several companies in the past, and he’s been in a CEO position for more than 22 years. But InfluxData was founded by Paul Dix, and Paul knew years ago that his role (best role?) was to lead the technical and product direction of the company, which lead him to Evan. Today we share that story as well as a glimpse into operating the business that built the defacto platform for building time series applications with deep roots in open source.

It has become quite absurd to argue that remoteness has to mean becoming a less visible and valued contributor to your organization. I hope this post can help you convince anyone who might still believe that communicating remotely still has to be a pain.

                    <span>The New Stack’s Jennifer Riggins covering Kubecon+CloudNativeCon 2021:
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has more than 138,000 contributors making over 7 million contributions to more than 100 open source projects. It’s reasonable that getting started in open source would feel overwhelming — to say the least. So how do you get started as a contributor to cloud native projects? How do you find a mentor or guide to help you along?
She draws many solid takeaways from a panel that discussed this exact topic at the event. This quote from Grafana’s Uchechukwu Obasi is spectacular:
“I think open source really changed my life,” Obasi said. “I’m African, I live in Africa, but having the opportunity to work on software that impacts millions of lives, it’s an opportunity that I never take for granted. If open source can change my life, it can change yours too.”

                    <span>With the release of Safari 15 for macOS Monterey, iPadOS 15, iOS 15, and watchOS, as well as macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina, WebKit brings significant advancements in privacy and security, improved interoperability, and a host of new features for web developers. Take a look.
We discussed a few of these in-depth on JS Party #195, but at the time I was referencing the beta features announcement and it was 404ing during the show. This is a much better resource.

William Morgan shares with us some of the finer Linkerd details, such as the underlying security theme, why native Kubernetes objects are preferable to more CRDs, and the joy of meeting team members in person.
Frederic Branczyk speaks about Parca, a new continuous system profiling tool that uses eBPF to help you understand what is happening on your hosts.
Andrew Rynhard gives us a great Talos OS and Kubespan perspective, and shares some really good follow-up videos on these topics.
The last conversation is with David Flanagan - you know him as Rawkode - about new beginnings. It’s only been less than two months since we’ve had him in episode 18, and he kept really busy. Caleb, his 3 weeks old baby boy, was the younge…</span>

With Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, we’re launching our most secure Pixel phone yet, with 5 years of security updates and the most layers of hardware security. These new Pixel smartphones take a layered security approach, with innovations spanning across the Google Tensor system on a chip (SoC) hardware to new Pixel-first features in the Android operating system, making it the first Pixel phone with Google security from the silicon all the way to the data center.

Outsourcing operations to third-party vendors has become a popular business strategy as it allows organizations to save money and increase operational efficiency. While these are positives for business operations, they do create significant security risks. These vendors have access to critical systems and customer data and so their security posture becomes equally as important.

Replit has a history of betting on nascent technologies. The first version of Replit used WebAssembly long before WebAssembly found widespread adoption. We’re betting that the Nix project will improve performance across the board, sidestep a whole slew of bugs for our community, and let any Replit user build and publish programming environments.

                    <span>There are many great articles written about the Seam Carving algorithm already, but I couldn’t resist the temptation to explore this elegant, powerful, and yet simple algorithm on my own, and to write about my personal experience with it. Another point that drew my attention (as a creator of javascript-algorithms repo) was the fact that Dynamic Programming (DP) approach might be smoothly applied to solve it. And, if you’re like me and still on your “learning algorithms” journey, this algorithmic solution may enrich your personal DP arsenal.

                    <span>In a world that is now gradually adopting HTTP/3 (which, as you know, is implemented over QUIC), the problem with the missing API for QUIC is still a key problem. There are a number of existing QUIC library implementation now since a few years back, and they are slowly maturing.

                    <span>Curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg:
We can’t know for sure which products are on the top list of the most widely deployed software components. There’s no method for us to count or estimate these numbers with a decent degree of certainty. We can only guess and make rough estimates – and it also depends on exactly what we count. And quite probably also depending on who‘s doing the counting.
He goes through his process of trying to determine contenders, and ends up with zlib, qlite, and libcurl. Other have added OpenSSL, expat and the Linux kernel to that list.

There are ~33k characters in the rematch repo, most of which are tests. I type ~500 characters per minute. So if I could sit down and type the correct code first time, without making mistakes or getting distracted, it would take 66 minutes. I don’t see any fundamental reason why I shouldn’t be able to at least approach that bound for such simple code - maybe get within 3 hours, say. So there is potentially room for another 10x speedup.
So let’s suppose a 10x speedup is within reach…

                    <span>It surprises me that when people think of “software that brings about the singularity” they think of text models, or of RL agents. But they sneer at decision tree boosting and the like as boring algorithms for boring problems.
To me, this seems counter-intuitive, and the fact that most people researching ML are interested in subjects like vision and language is flabbergasting. For one, because getting anywhere productive in these fields is really hard, for another, because their usefulness seems relatively minimal.

                    <span>The business context for a rent versus buy dichotomy was first introduced to me by Adam a few years back. It has since then proven very useful as a tool for thinking about the relationship people have to their jobs/companies.
In this post, Cate Huston does an excellent job laying it all out, including which things are generally rented, and which things are generally bought.
Thinking about career decisions this way, you can consider different tradeoffs and options that work best for you at any given time… My question is: are you making those choices mindfully? And do they work for the life and career you want?

                    <span>Hummingbot integrates cryptocurrency trading on both centralized exchanges and decentralized protocols. It allows users to run a client that executes customized, automated trading strategies for cryptocurrencies.
We created Hummingbot to promote decentralized market-making: enabling members of the community to contribute to the liquidity and trading efficiency in cryptocurrency markets.
There are many arbitrage opportunities between centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance (which often have high liquidity) and decentralized exchanges like Loopring and Terra (which thus far rarely have high liquidity).
If you have the financial stomach for it, Hummingbot could help you take advantage of these opportunities while providing liquidity to the decentralized markets.

                    <span>Martin Tournoij lays out a bunch of ways he finds zsh more compelling than bash.
There are many more things. I’m not going to list them all here. None of this is new; much (if not all?) of this has around for 20 years, if not longer. I don’t know why bash is the de-facto default, or why people spend time on complex solutions to work around bash problems when zsh solves them. I guess because Linux used a lot of GNU stuff and bash was came with it, and GNU stuff was (and is) using bash. Not a very good reason, certainly not one 30 years later.

                    <span>This week Gerhard is talking with Arnaud Porterie, founder of EchoesHQ, a new utility that measures and communicates engineering activity.
They start by re-creating the 60 seconds Y Combinator pitch, and then shift focus to what it was like to get EchoesHQ off the ground. Next, they tackle something which is always on Gerhard’s mind: Why is it important to connect our daily engineering activity to intent?
Before EchoesHQ, Arnaud used to run the core team and the open source project at Docker, and combined with other engineering leadership roles that he held for over a decade, he kept encountering misalignment that was preventing organisations from making meaningful progress. Let’s hear why EchoesHQ might just be a great way of addressing this.

An analysis of current and potential kernel security mitigations
  
Posted by Jann Horn, Project Zero
  
Introduction
This blog post describes a straightforward Linux kernel locking bug and how I exploited it against Debian Buster&#x27;s 4.19.0-13-amd64 kernel. Based on that, it explores options for security mitigations that could prevent or hinder exploitation of issues similar to this one.
I hope that stepping through such an exploit and sharing this compiled knowledge with the wider security community can help with reasoning about the relative utility of various mitigation approaches.

                    <span>Organizations that rely on developing secure, functional products understand the value of increased collaboration between security and development teams.

Tighter partnerships between the two teams can allow organizations to deliver better, safer products faster, but how can this work in the real world?</span>
