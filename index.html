On 24th April 2021, Angular announced the deprecation of their E2E testing tool protractor. It was unclear if there will be a successor or if Angular delegates this to its users. In this article, I will provide a short overview over the differences between the various E2E frameworks, and argue why you should use Cypress.

However, in the face of failure, the car may end up on fire, flying off a cliff.

If you‚Äôre building a new app today, it might be worth taking a closer look at making it cloud-native and using Kubernetes from the jump. The effort to set up Kubernetes is less than you think. Certainly, it‚Äôs less than the effort it would take to refactor your app later on to support containerization.

So, in this article we will explore this great Python module and make the most out of the every function included in it.

To recap our progress on these goals, here is a snapshot of what VRP has accomplished with the community over the past 10 years:

                <p>9 out of 10 AI projects don‚Äôt end up creating value in production. Why? At least partly because these projects utilize unstable models and drifting data.

                <p>Posted by Charlie Reis‚Äã and Alex Moshchuk, Chrome Security Team
Chrome's Site Isolation is an essential security defense that makes it harder for malicious web sites to steal data from other web sites. On Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS, Site Isolation protects all web sites from each other, and also ensures they do not share processes with extensions, which are more highly privileged than web sites. As of Chrome 92, we will start extending this capability so that extensions can no longer share processes‚Ä¶</p>

It‚Äôs no secret that lack of diversity in corporate America is a well-documented problem and improvements have been slow.

                <p>There are server colocation providers that allow hosting a 1U server for as low as $30/month, but there‚Äôs a catch: There are restrictions on power usage (1A @ 120v max, for example) because they‚Äôre expecting small and power-efficient network equipment like firewalls.
This repo is about designing a server that fits within the 1U space and 1A @ 120v power constraint while maximizing computing power, storage, and value.
