                    <span>Red Hat’s decision to lock down RHEL sources behind a subscription paywall was met with much ire and opened opportunity for Oracle to get a smack in and SUSE to announce a fork with $10 million behind it.
Few RHEL community members have been as publicly irate as Jeff Geerling, so we invited him on the show to discuss.

                    <span>This week we’re talking about type checking with Jake Zimmerman. Jake is one of the leads at Stripe working on Sorbet — an open source project that does Type checking in Ruby and runs over Stripe’s entire Ruby codebase. As of May of 2022 Stripe’s codebase was over 15 million lines of code spread across 150,000 files. If you think you have a bigger Ruby codebase, Jake is down to go byte-for-byte to see who wins. Jake shares tons of wisdom and more importantly he shares why he thinks types will win in the end.

They discussed how to streamline and enable modern development in generative AI and large language models (LLMs).  Their new tool, Codeium, was born out of the insights they gleaned from their work in GPU software and solutions development, particularly with respect to generative AI, large language models, and supporting infrastructure.  Codeium is a free AI-powered toolkit for developers, with in-house models and infrastructure - not another API wrapper.

                    <span>In this Fully Connected episode, Daniel and Chris explore recent highlights from the current model proliferation wave sweeping the world - including Stable Diffusion XL, OpenChat, Zeroscope XL, and Salesforce XGen.  They note the rapid rise of open models, and speculate that just as in open source software, open models will dominate the future.  Such rapid advancement creates its own problems though, so they finish by itemizing concerns such as cybersecurity, workflow productivity, and impact on human culture.

                    <span>Listener Joe Davidson recently tweeted: “I’d really be interested in an episode debating Kubernetes vs serverless functions for distributed systems. As someone working a lot with serverless to create large scale systems, for me the complexity in Kubernetes doesn’t seem worth it, especially when onboarding new people. But I’d like to see it from the other perspectives. I could be missing something.”
So we invited Joe on the show alongside Abdel Sghiouar and Srdjan Petrovic to discuss!

In February, we expanded Google Workspace client-side encryption (CSE) capabilities to include Gmail and Calendar in addition to Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet.
CSE in Gmail was designed to provide commercial and public sector organizations an additional layer of confidentiality and data integrity protection beyond the existing encryption offered by default in Workspace. When CSE is enabled, email messages are protected using encryption keys that are fully under the customer’s control. The data is encrypted on the client device before it’s sent to Google servers that do not have access to the encryption keys, which means the data is indecipherable to us–we have no tec…</span>

                    <span>Your feed might be dominated by LLMs these days, but there are some amazing things happening in computer vision that you shouldn’t ignore! In this episode, we bring you one of those amazing stories from Gabriel Ortiz, who is working with the government of Cantabria in Spain to automate cartography and apply AI to geospatial analysis. We hear about how AI tooling fits into the GIS workflow, and Gabriel shares some of his recent work (including work that can identify individual people, invasive plant species, building and more from aerial survey data).

“Secure your dependencies”—it’s the new supply chain mantra. With attacks targeting software supply chains sharply rising, open source developers need to monitor and judge the risks of the projects they rely on. Our previous installment of the Supply chain security for Go series shared the ecosystem tools available to Go developers to manage their dependencies and vulnerabilities. This second installment describes the ways that Go helps you trust the integrity of a Go package. 










Go has built-in protections against three major ways packages can be compromised before reaching you: 

A new, malicious version of your dependency is published

A package is withdrawn from the ecosystem

                    <span>This is a fancified excerpt of Jonathan Norris’ unpopular opinion on Go Time #275. Jonathan is Co-Founder &amp; CTO @ DevCycle where they’re using WebAssembly in very interesting ways. To get the full experience you should listen while you read.
🎧  Click here to listen along while you read. It&#x27;s better!   🎧
The advantages of WebAssembly, with its:
tight security model
very fast boot-up time
scalability at the edge
much smaller footprints
portability across environments
will really drive a shift away from container-based runtimes for things Kubernetes and edge workloads by 2030. There’s a ton of energy around making this happen within the WebAssembly community.

                    <span>This week we’re joined by Adam Jacob and we’re talking about his mission at System Initiative to rebuild DevOps. They are out of stealth mode and ready to show off their transformative new power tool that reimagines what’s possible from DevOps. It’s an intelligent automation platform that allows DevOps teams to build detailed interactive simulations of their infrastructure and use them to rapidly update their production environments.

2022 was a successful year for Google&#x27;s Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs), with over 2,900 security issues identified and fixed, and over $12 million in bounty rewards awarded to researchers. A significant amount of these vulnerability reports helped improve the security of Google Cloud products, which in turn helps improve security for our users, customers, and the Internet at large.





We first announced the Google Cloud VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of Google Cloud and to incentivize sharing knowledge on Cloud vulnerability research with the world. This year, we were excited to see an increase in collaboration between researchers, which often led to more detailed and complex vulnerabilit…</span>

                    <span>Chris and Daniel take a step back to look at how generative AI fits into the wider landscape of ML/AI and data science. They talk through the differences in how one approaches “traditional” supervised learning and how practitioners are approaching generative AI based solutions (such as those using Midjourney or GPT family models). Finally, they talk through the risk and compliance implications of generative AI, which was in the news this week in the EU.

Visibility into Extensions being used in your environment


Having visibility into what and how extensions are being used enables IT and security teams to assess potential security implications, ensure compliance with organizational policies, and mitigate potential risks. There are three ways you can get critical information about extensions in your organization:
1. App and extension usage reporting
Organizations can gain visibility into every Chrome extension that is installed across an enterprise’s fleet in Chrome App and Extension Usage Reporting.
2. Extension Risk Assessment
