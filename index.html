                    <span>Adam was invited by our friends at Square to interview Jack Dorsey as part of their annual developer conference called Square Unboxed. Jack Dorsey is one of the most prolific CEOs out there — he’s a hacker turned CEO and is often working at the very edge of what’s to come (at scale). Jack is focused on what the future has to offer, he’s considered an innovator by many. He’s also a Bitcoin maximalist and has positioned himself and Block long on Bitcoin.
What you’re about to hear is the fireside chat Adam had with Jack at Square Unboxed 2022. Jack and Adam discuss the vision Square has for the developer platform and why it’s so central to the company’s strategy.

                    <span>Connect’s creators call it a “better gRPC”, but I am in no position to evaluate that claim so I will leave it as an exercise for you. Here’s what they have to say about it:
Connect is production-ready — focused, simple, and debuggable — and it’s fully compatible with gRPC clients and servers. If you’re frustrated by the complexity and instability of today’s gRPC libraries, we think you’ll find Connect a breath of fresh air.
Go library out now. Connect for TypeScript is “coming soon”

The VSCodium project exists so that you don’t have to download+build from source. This project includes special build scripts that clone Microsoft’s vscode repo, run the build commands, and upload the resulting binaries for you to GitHub releases. These binaries are licensed under the MIT license. Telemetry is disabled.
They also have various package managers covered, so you can brew install --cask vscodium, etc.

                    <span>I entered Rust four years ago. To this moment, I co-authored teloxide and dptree, wrote several publications and translated a number of language release announcements. I also managed to write some production code in Rust, and had a chance to speak at one online meetup dedicated to Rust. Still, from time to time I find myself disputing with Rust’s borrow checker and type system for no practical reason. Yes, I am no longer stupefied by such errors as cannot return reference to temporary value – over time, I developed multiple heuristic strategies to cope with lifetimes…
But one recent situation has made me to fail ignominiously.

                    <span>Posted by Harshvardhan Sharma, Information Security Engineer, Google 

2021 was another record-breaking year for our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). We paid a total of $8.7 million in rewards, our highest amount yet. 2021 saw some amazing work from the security research community. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the reports we received were for findings in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. It is heartening to see an increasing number of talented researchers getting involved in cloud security.
We first announced the GCP VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of GCP, in turn helping us make GCP more secure for our users, customers, and the internet at large. Even 3 years into the program, the submissions we are getting never cea…</span>

Return values from different expressions in a with block can only be distinguished by the shape of the data returned. This creates ambiguity in with’s else clauses that make code harder to understand and more challenging to modify correctly.
The author describes the problem in detail and even provides two alternatives to with..else that avoid the resulting ambiguity.

Every now and again I come across some discussion on making Emacs “modern”.1 The argument always go more or less like this - Emacs doesn’t look and behave like  and the world will end if we don’t copy something “crucial” from it…
If you ask me - there’s pretty much nothing we can do that would suddenly make Emacs as popular as VS Code. But you know what - that’s perfectly fine. After all there are plenty of “modern” editors that are even less popular than Emacs, so clearly being “modern” doesn’t make you popular. And there’s also our “arch-nemesis” vim, that’s supposedly as “dated” as Emacs, but is extremely popular.

The cheat system cuts to the chase. You don’t have to piece together clues about how to use a command. You just follow the examples. Of course, for complex commands, it’s not a shortcut for a thorough study of the actual documentation, but for quick reference, it’s as fast as it gets.

                    <span>Accessing a major critical infrastructure network is very appealing to cybercriminals, as they can maximize societal impact and demand large ransom sums to fix tampered systems. With recent high-profile attacks, including that against the Colonial Pipeline in March 2021, it has become clear that the organizations handling critical infrastructure networks are now in the firing line. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to both threat groups that are evolving their tactics and public scrutiny if they do not remain transparent when an attack occurs.</span>

                    <span>When we had Paul Copplestone from Supabase on The Changelog I asked him what a cloud native Postgres would look like. He replied,
Decoupled compute and storage. So the idea is that you should be able to attach the compute part of it to a storage, hopefully like an infinite storage; you know, anything that is infinitely scalable. If you can do this, and in particular, if the compute can start up very fast, maybe in, say, a hundred milliseconds via some sort of HTTP response, then that’s cloud native, yeah.
Enter Neon, which sells itself as:
The multi-cloud fully managed Postgres with a generous free tier. We separated storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage.
Behind this new business from MemSQL co-founder Nikita Shamgunov is the linked (Apache-licensed) server written in Rust.

                    <span>Spoiler alert: it’s a Pi-hole
How does the Pi Hole work though? The Pi Hole answers your computer’s DNS queries and if it is a domain on the blacklist, it sends the request to the Pi Web server.  This Web server just serves up a blank page.  So instead of loading the ad from the real domain, the blank page from the Pi is downloaded, thus “blocking” the ad or metric.
How effective is the setup, in practice?
Statistically speaking our household is averaging 15% of queries blocked and a spike over a bad weather weekend of 30% blocked. It is scary and incredible to think the number of ads and metrics forced upon us, and this number continues to increase. I am delighted with the Pi Hole project and am recommending it to all.

                    <span>This week we’re peeking into the future again — this time we’re looking at the future of modern code review and workflows around pull requests. Jerod and Adam were joined by two of the co-founders of Graphite — Tomas Reimers and Greg Foster.
Graphite is an open-source CLI and code review dashboard built for engineers who want to write and review smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster. We cover all the details – how they got started, how this product emerged from another idea they were working on, the state of adoption, why stacking changes is the way of the future, how it’s just Git under the hood, and what they’re doing with the $20M in funding they just got from a16z.

                    <span>Last week I logged the very impressive Imagen project, which smarter people than me have said is the SOTA for text-to-image synthesis. Now a WIP implementation is just a pip install imagen-pytorch away.
Architecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.

DuckDuckGo, the privacy centric search firm have been found to be allowing Microsoft trackers through their browser. It’s dishonest, and I’m really disappointed.
Noteworthy: this is the DDG browser, which I’ve never used. Not the search engine. But still, this is concerning like Kev says:
DuckDuckGo tout themselves as being highly transparent and privacy respecting in everything they do. So to discover that they have been keeping this tidbit of information from their users — one that goes against the very fibre of the company — is a little concerning for me.

If you prefer, you can experiment with the latest 3.39.0 code directly in your web-browser and without having to download or install anything by visiting sqlite.org/fiddle/. (The page name is by analogy to sites like “JSFiddle” and “SQLFiddle”.)
The page runs a WASM-compiled copy of a recent 3.39.0 build in a sandbox in your web browser. Using controls on that page, you can import database files from your local machine (assuming they aren’t too big), work with them, then export any changes back to your desktop.
WebAssembly FTW!

                    <span>Unreproducible issues, although rare, are typical for each project, sooner or later. They can affect different system parts and make us many causes for investigating and fixing them.
In this article, I try to share some of the techniques I have used in such investigations, which gave me great help in such scenarios. I hope they are helpful to you (if you did not use them already). And, if you have techniques of your own, share them!

                    <span>Ken Kantzer was part of ~20 code audits of companies that had just raised their A or B rounds of funding:
It was fascinating work – we dove deep on a great cross-section of stacks and architectures, across a wide variety of domains. We found all sorts of security issues, ranging from catastrophic to just plain interesting. And we also had a chance to chat with senior engineering leadership and CTOs more generally about the engineering and product challenges they were facing as they were just starting to scale.
In this post he shares some of the more surprising things he’s learned from the experience. There’s a lot to digest in this post, but I’ll highlight my favorite to whet your whistle:
Simple Outperformed Smart. As a self-admitted elitist, it pains me to say this, but it’s true: the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to engineering. Cleverness for cleverness sake was abhorred. On the flip side, the companies where we were like ”woah, these folks are smart as hell” for the most part kind of faded.

Memory safety in Chrome is an ever-ongoing effort to protect our users. We are constantly experimenting with different technologies to stay ahead of malicious actors. In this spirit, this post is about our journey of using heap scanning technologies to improve memory safety of C++.




Let’s start at the beginning though. Throughout the lifetime of an application its state is generally represented in memory. Temporal memory safety refers to the problem of guaranteeing that memory is always accessed with the most up to date information of its structure, its type. C++ unfortunately does not provide such guarantees. While there is appetite for different languages than C++ with stronger memory safety guarantee…</span>

                    <span>This is the post-KubeCon CloudNativeCon EU 2022 week. Gerhard is talking to Matt Moore, founder &amp; CTO of Chainguard about all things Knative and Sigstore.
The most important topic is swag, because none has better stickers than Chainguard.
The other topic is the equivalent of Let’s Encrypt for securing software.

                    <span>YouTubeDrive is a Wolfram Language (aka Mathematica) package that encodes/decodes arbitrary data to/from simple RGB videos which are automatically uploaded to/downloaded from YouTube. Since YouTube imposes no limits on the total number or length of videos users can upload, this provides an effectively infinite but extremely slow form of file storage.

                    <span>Billy Wilcosky:
Flat file web software is about having a set up which doesn’t use a “traditional” database. Instead it uses plain text files, other files, and/or maybe something like a json feed to store the data.
In this post, he explains why he thinks flat file web software is on the come up (again):
Flat file software can be powerful. Depending on what you need. And I think with the right developers and brain power behind the movement it can be more scalable and secure. The sky’s the limit. When I hear a developer saying, no, flat file isn’t good because… really all I’m hearing is they don’t want to change the way web software works. Because what I’ve found is most anything is possible.
Here’s a couple of flat file platforms which are incredible. One is a CMS/blog, the other a forum. Yes, a flat file forum.
A somewhat-related categorical question: Does SQLite count?

                    <span>Google researchers are giving DALL-E a run for its money:
Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model.

                    <span>This package wraps the graphql-go/graphql implementation to provide a “fluent” pattern for constructing GraphQL queries in Go. This can be valuable in situations where dynamic queries are desired: when the fields of a GraphQL query (or mutation) are not known until runtime. For most other use cases, plain query strings or a helper library such as this should be sufficient.
I wonder if this would change Mislav’s unpopular GraphQL/Go opinion…

Developers from certain languages [Java] have learned to wield this design principle with more power than many others. It’s how we end up with so much stuff in code bases that’s just… there. Existing. Superficially it appears unused, but silently and stoically, we know it protects us from the turbulent future change which lurks ever ahead.

He calls himself a “public-interest technologist”, a term he coined himself, and works at the intersection of security, technology, and people.
Bruce has been writing about security issues on his blog since 2004, his monthly newsletter has been going since 1998, he’s a fellow and lecturer at Harvard’s Kennedy School, a board member of the EFF, and the Chief of Security Architecture at Inrupt. Long story short, Bruce has credentials to back up his opinions and on today’s show we dig into the state of cyber-security, security and privacy best practices, his thoughts on Bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies), Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid project, and of course…</span>

Adolfo is a Staff Software Engineer at Chainguard, and one of the technical leads for SIG release, meaning that he helps ship Kubernetes. You most likely know him as Puerco, and have seen first-hand his passion for securing software via SBOMs, cosign and SLSA. Puerco’s love for bikes and Chainguard are a great match 🚴‍♂️

                    <span>David Crawshaw gave an excellent talk (at Go Northwest in 2018) on using SQLite (so hot right now) together with Go and how enjoyable/productive the combo is. Quite worthy of its ~30 minutes runtime.

                    <span>Ryan Dahl describes the JavaScript sandbox as a higher level container for server software:
This container isn’t meant to address the same breadth of problems that Linux containers target. Its emergence is a result of its simplicity. It minimizes the boilerplate for web service business logic. It shares concepts with the browser and reduces the concepts that the programmer needs to know.
People like Ryan and his colleagues at Deno are exploring this future, but it’s not quite here yet.

What began inside of GitHub to help them thrive and connect is now available to every product team on the planet. Rewatch lets teams save, manage, and search all their video content so they can collaborate async and with greater flexibility. We talk about where the tool’s inspiration came from (spoiler alert, inside GitHub it was called GitHub TV which you’ll hear during the show), how teams leverage video to reduce the constraints of communication, how Connor and his co-founder knew they had product-fit and how they grew the team and product, and of course the flip side of that — we talk about some of Connor’s failures along the way, and knowing when it’s the right time to take a big swing.

Among these are openness, fairness, inclusivity, technical excellence, “community over product/company,” built-in quality and built-in security. I’m part of the initial group of maintainers of the project, currently made up by the top six committers of the project within EDB.
If you’ve been following Ship It’s Kaizen episodes, you know we had troubles running Postgres in K8s and recently moved to a managed (sorta) database. I wonder if Gerhard will be tempted to try this operator out anyhow…

Because of my background and life with Open Source and probably a lot because of the relative success some of my projects have had, I frequently get questions about subjects related to maintaining Open Source. How to run a project and what makes them succeed? For a long time I have been collecting lessons from my life with Open Source into a list of advice for fellow Open Source library hackers. This document is my attempt to convert those thoughts and experiences into words.
I don’t believe it’s finished, but there’s a lot here already! Excited for this and while it’s a free to read GitBook right now, I hope it ends with some kind of physical manifestation.

At the KubeCon EU 2022 conference in Valencia, security researchers from Palo Alto Networks presented research findings on “trampoline pods”—pods with an elevated set of privileges required to do their job, but that could conceivably be used as a jumping off point to gain escalated privileges.
The research mentions GKE, including how developers should look at the privileged pod problem today, what the GKE team is doing to minimize the use of privileged pods, and actions GKE users can take to protect their clusters.
Privileged pods within the context of GKE security

While privileged pods can pose a security issue, it’s important to look at them within the overall context of GKE security. To use a privileged pod as a “trampoline” in GKE, …</span>

                    <span>I had the honor of joining Robby Russell (who you may remember from Oh My Zsh) on his Maintainable podcast for a super-fun discussion on well-maintained software. Here’s how Robby describes it:
Robby has a chat with Jerod Santo, the Managing Editor and Partner of Changelog Media. Jerod helps lead and co-host Changelog’s flagship podcast, The Changelog, and builds all the cool stuff that makes Changelog awesome. Jerod shares his journey from being a typical networking engineer (Infosec) to the experienced programmer that he is today and his programming wisdom from the trenches.
Tune in as he highlights the undeniable importance of automated test suites and code readability, describes the arc of an engineer’s career, and talks about the past experiences that make him lean more towards clarity over cleverness when coding. He also shares some of the things engineers should consider in regard to pulling in third-party code or writing from scratch, and so much more. Enjoy!
Thanks for having me, Robby! 💚

                    <span>James Simone ponders the relationship between healthy teams and performance in the software world.
Here’s what it comes down to: teams perform well when successes are shared and failures are owned… We don’t celebrate successes enough, and part of that (I think) is caused by the feeling of pressure that comes from working on a project that seems dooomed to fail without meticulous and ever-present attention.
He goes on to delve in to the source(s) of engineering failures, the dangers of “brightsizing”, known predictors for project success, and a bunch of related topics. Lots to ponder here alongside James, who’s seen a lot of software projects live &amp; die during his eight years in the business.

                    <span>WANT!
Framework has created a really slick, fully user serviceable, laptop and have recently started selling the mainboard as a SBC for general use.  To better support folks who may want to integrate it into their projects, they are also releasing technical documentation including  pinouts, cad models and other resources.
When they reached out and explained their plans and offered to let me play with one, I jumped at the chance and this is what I came up with after some experimentation.

                    <span>Good for them (and us)! But what does that mean in practice?
Over the next few months, we’ll be completing the OpenJS Foundation’s incubation program checklist, including transferring the Jest domain, repo, website, and other assets to OpenJS. We’ll also be updating the code of conduct and contributor license agreement.
Additionally, as part of this move, we will be publishing a project charter and creating new governance policies that will document the process for gaining commit access, as well as our leadership selection process.

                    <span>Firefox uses a multi-process model for additional security and stability while browsing: Web Content (such as HTML/CSS and Javascript) is rendered in separate processes that are isolated from the rest of the operating system and managed by a privileged parent process. This way, the amount of control gained by an attacker that exploits a bug in a content process is limited. In this article, we would like to dive a bit further into the latest major milestone we have reached: Win32k Lockdown, which greatly reduces the capabilities of the content process when running on Windows.

And we know that challenges with image-based technologies and representation on the web have historically left people of color feeling overlooked and misrepresented. Last year, we announced Real Tone for Pixel, which is just one example of our efforts to improve representation of diverse skin tones across Google products.
Today, we&#x27;re introducing a next step in our commitment to image equity and improving representation across our products.

                    <span>[TL;DR]
Nearly 24 years ago, Google started with two graduate students, one product, and a big mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission.
The progress we&#x27;ve made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O.
Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them.

From the beginning, we set out to connect words in your search to words on a page so we could make the web’s information more accessible and useful. Over 20 years later, as the web changes, and the ways people consume information expand from text to images to videos and more — the one constant is that language remains a surprisingly powerful tool for understanding information.


In recent years, we’ve seen an incredible acceleration in the field of natural language understanding. While our systems still don’t understand language the way people do, they’re increasingly able to spot patterns in information, identify comp…</span>

And over the past few years, our investments in AI have supercharged the ability to bring you the most helpful information about the real world, including when a business is open and how crowded your bus is. Today at Google I/O, we announced new ways the latest advancements in AI are transforming Google Maps — helping you explore with an all-new immersive view of the world, find the most fuel-efficient route, and use the magic of Live View in your favorite third-party apps.

                    <span>For years, Google Translate has helped break down language barriers and connect communities all over the world. And we want to make this possible for even more people — especially those whose languages aren’t represented in most technology. So today we’ve added 24 languages to Translate, now supporting a total of 133 used around the globe.
Over 300 million people speak these newly added languages — like Mizo, used by around 800,000 people in the far northeast of India, and Lingala, used by over 45 million people across Central Africa. As part of this update, Indigenous languages of the Americas (Quechua, Guarani and Aymara) and an English dialect (Sierra Leonean Krio) have also been added to Translate for the first time.

                    <span>I love when software engineers share their career/life choices and the reasoning behind them so others can benefit from their perspective, like this one on bucket filling:
Somebody once described balance to me as three buckets filled with water. One for career, a second for physical health, and a third for social and family life. At any point, one bucket might be running low. But as long as the overall water level is high enough, things should be fine.
Scott’s choice to join a startup seems odd given his reason for leaving Google, but:
So: am I happier? Undoubtedly yes.
I work more hours. I’m more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now. But what I do makes a difference that I can see. Progress feels 10x faster.
Most surprising is that I have more energy. It’s easier to find motivation to get back in the gym. I have more energy in social situations.
Working more hours sounds like tipping the work/life balance in the wrong direction, but excitement about your work certainly changes the calculus. He’s happier now, so that’s great!

Object-oriented, cute, really popular, and a bit naive. Had a bit of Fry grafted onto herself for a while. Also had a thing with Bender. And Zapp. Easy going, but doesn’t do well in difficult situations, falls over easily.
Bender is Shell. Fry is Perl. If you care at all for his reasoning, you’ve already clicked through!

Every year at I/O we share the latest on privacy and security features on Android. But we know some users like to go a level deeper in understanding how we’re making the latest release safer, and more private, while continuing to offer a seamless experience. So let’s dig into the tools we’re building to better secure your data, enhance your privacy and increase trust in the apps and experiences on your devices.  
Low latency, frictionless security

                    <span>Posted by Daniel Margolis, Software Engineer, Google Account Security Team 
Every year, security technologies improve: browsers get better, encryption becomes ubiquitous on the Web, authentication becomes stronger. But phishing persistently remains a threat (as shown by a recent phishing attack on the U.S. Department of Labor) because users retain the ability to log into their online accounts, often with a simple password, from anywhere in the world. It’s why today at I/O we announced new ways we’re reducing the risks of phishing by: scaling phishing protections to Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, continuing to auto enroll people in 2-Step Verification and more. This blog will deep dive into the method of phishing and how it has evolved today.

                    <span>This week Sid Sijbrandij Co-founder and CEO of GitLab is back talking with Adam about all the details of their massive IPO last October 2021. To set the stage, this episode was recorded on Feb 1, 2022. During the show Adam mentioned they IPO’d at a $13B market cap, but they actually ended their opening day at approximately $15B. That’s a massive win for open source, GitLab, Sid, and the rest of the team. For loyal listeners you know we’ve had Sid on this show before, so of course we had to get him back on the show post-IPO to get all the details of this new journey.

For those who haven’t used Emacs, it’s something you’ll likely hate, but may love. It’s sort of a Rube Goldberg machine the size of a house that, at first glance, performs all the functions of a toaster. That hardly sounds like an endorsement, but the key phrase is “at first glance.” Once you grok Emacs, you realize that it’s a thermonuclear toaster that can also serve as the engine for… well, just about anything you want to do with text.

                    <span>Lots of cool stuff for Markdown authors in April’s VS Code release. Namely:
drag and drop files into the editor to create a Markdown link
find all references to header|links|files|urls inside of Markdown
rename headers|links inside Markdown (and propagate the changes)
rename Markdown files (and propagate to all references)
The Dendron team is excited because their primary vault hosts over 400k lines of Markdown 🤯
VS Code, and IDEs more broadly, help developers manage large code bases by making available tools to leverage and manipulate the syntax of programming languages. By shifting some of this tooling to markdown, can we do the same for large Markdown repositories?

                    <span>I’ve long been fascinated by literate programming (the art of writing code as if it was a novel), but it’s been awhile since I’ve seen a good example of in practice. Here’s a good one:
I wanted to showcase the BDD-inspired low-tech solution I came up with via a toy project, demonstrating a small but significant programming task, broken down as series of design-implementation cycles.
Wordle is a perfect target: it’s a small codebase, with a half dozen features to string together into a useable game.
This story has five chapters and a satisfying conclusion:
This project was my first foray into literate programming at this scale, an attempt to bring together all the good ideas of TDD, modern Python development, Gherkin usage for requirements traceability purposes (without overly zealous extremes of Cucumber automation). All these ideas were until now scattered, implemented each without the others in different places, and this project fuses them into something I hope is more valuable than the sum of its parts.
