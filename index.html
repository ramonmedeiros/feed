                    <span>As a university student, Abigail Annkah fell in love with mathematics, which soon led to her interest in artificial intelligence. After graduating from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Abigail made it through the competitive process to become an AI resident at Google Research, Accra. After her residency, Google offered her a job and she‚Äôs now a research software engineer working on several high-profile projects.
As Google grows its presence in Accra, we spoke to Abigail about the mapping project that motivates her, starting a new job while becoming a mother and the importance of inspiring young girls to enter STEM careers.

                    <span>B. Cameron Gain on The New Stack:
Despite an ample amount of documentation and demos made available by Grafana Labs and community members, Grafana can be a challenge to set up (although those that do get its dashboards working generally sing its praises). Many manual configurations and steps are required when installing the different dashboard options. Once installed, many users can be overwhelmed with the number of logs and other data to process for monitoring and observability.
Grafana sure does produce pretty (useful) dashboards üëá, but I do find it overwhelming at times.

                    <span>Martin Heinz on the tools/techniques for finding bottlenecks in your Python code. And fixing them, fast.
The first rule of optimization is to not do it. If you really have to though, then optimize where appropriate. Use the above profiling tools to find bottlenecks, so you don‚Äôt waste time optimizing some inconsequential piece of code. It‚Äôs also useful to create a reproducible benchmark for the piece of code you‚Äôre trying to optimize, so that you can measure the actual improvement.

                    <span>In our first 2022 episode, Alexis Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Weaveworks, is talking to Gerhard about going fully remote, what a great team looks like, and GitOps. While you may have heard of GitOps, now is a good time to check out opengitops.dev.
The most interesting part of today‚Äôs conversation is the missing cloud native App Store. While Apple revolutionised the world with the App Store and the iPhone, we don‚Äôt yet have something similar for cloud native apps. You may be thinking ‚ÄúBut what about OperatorHub?‚Äù, or all the Helm registries out there? The registry fragmentation, operator deprecations and lack of curation are not what people have in mind when they think App Store. But there is more to it, so let‚Äôs hear how Alexis thinks about this.

                    <span>Back in the olden days, I would just put a mysqldump &gt; dump.sql in a crontab and called it a day. When I started to host more and more stuff with docker, I first just migrated that approach to docker and put it all in a container. That still required me to mess around with config files. Once I started to host postgres containers it all got even more complicated. Thus, I needed a new solution.
I built this tool to make backups easy: Simply point it to a host running docker containers and it will automatically inspect and find all mysql/mariadb and postgres containers and do backups of them on a schedule. No configuration required, it ‚Äújust works‚Äù.

Further this project also provides a tiny convenience command named em to start Emacs server and edit files using Emacs server. This helps in using Emacs efficiently.

                    <span>Previously, we compiled a Go program into a WebAssembly and then converted it into C++ files to make it run on Nintendo Switch. Now, I have succeeded in compiling a Go program into a native binary for Nintendo Switch, and also running a game there. I replaced system calls with C function calls using the -overlay option.

                    <span>Oliver Brotchie developed this CSS fingerprinting technique that requires no Javascript or Cookies to function and avoids anti-tracking methods such as NoScript, VPNs or browser extensions.
CSS Fingerprinting is a technique of tracking and gathering information on site visitors. This method exploits the nature of CSS to track various characteristics about the visitor‚Äôs browser and device, which can later be used to either identify or track said visitor.
Right now, at current spec, this method doesn‚Äôt scale, but with the next upcoming draft of the CSS specification, CSS Values 4, it will become far more scalable and precise.

Without dura, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state. That‚Äôs so 2021. Computers crash and Ctrl-Z only works on files independently. Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can revert to ‚Äú4 hours ago‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever‚Äù. Finally, some sanity.
This sounds a lot like how Fossil works out of the box, except maybe even more paranoid because Fossil will propagate every commit whereas Dura propagates all changes even before they‚Äôre committed.

                    <span>RSS-Bridge is a PHP project capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don‚Äôt have one. It can be used on webservers or as a stand-alone application in CLI mode.
I made a very poor-man‚Äôs version of this as my first ever Sinatra app way back in the day. It‚Äôs cool to see that vision live on, but it sucks that tools like this have to exist. It seems that the author agrees with me on that:
We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have your service with your applications using your API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.
We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

                    <span>OpenDrop is a command-line tool that allows sharing files between devices directly over Wi-Fi. Its unique feature is that it is protocol-compatible with Apple AirDrop which allows to share files with Apple devices running iOS and macOS.
Super cool, but with a disclaimer: this is the result of reverse engineering the transfer protocol, so the odds of it being flakey (especially as Apple ships OS updates) are high. It‚Äôd be rad if Apple would publish an AirDrop-compatible specification for the community to rally around.
You know, like they did with FaceTime. üòâ

At the same time, we have continued our commitment to realizing the potential of quantum computers in various applications. That&#x27;s why we published results in top journals, collaborated with researchers across academia and industry, and expanded our team to bring on new talent and expertise.

There, he looks for burial places of these nomadic warriors who rode through Asia 2,500 years ago. The work isn‚Äôt easy, from dealing with extreme temperatures, to swamps covered with mosquitos. But the biggest challenge is staying one step ahead of tomb raiders.
It‚Äôs believed that more than 90% of the tombs ‚Äî called kurgans ‚Äî have already been destroyed by raiders looking to profit off what they find, but Gino is looking for the thousands he believes remain scattered across Russia, Mongolia and Western China.

                    <span>This is the first (of probably many) ‚Äúplaying with generics‚Äù post we‚Äôll see now that Go 1.18 is in beta with official support for the controversial feature.
This post aims to describe my initial experience converting my markphelps/optional library from using code generation to using generics instead. Hopefully, after reading this post you‚Äôll have a better understanding of what generics can do for you and what they can‚Äôt.
Mark shares lots of good tips along the way. His findings are quite positive:
I ‚ù§Ô∏è that I was able to delete 95% of my code because of generics.
I think that generics will be very beneficial to maintainers who create libraries for things like my own as well as for searching, sorting, transformations, and the like. I can also see some them being extremely helpful for creating well-tested libraries around the various concurrency patterns that are sometimes tricky to get right.

Microservices are getting natural and we almost feel like we‚Äôve been always living in the world of microservices. Lately when I talked to other developers and asked how they would start a greenfield project, almost certainly the answer was, well, one microservice for this, another one for this, another one for user management, one more for authentication, another for authorization, one more for session management, and the list could go on.
I‚Äôm gonna try to shed some light on what nobody is talking about when it comes to microservices. And yeah, it‚Äôs gonna be a first-hand experience from a past projects I worked on.
This excellent piece gave me some serious deja vu of [Kelsey Hightower‚Äôs monoliths are the future. I‚Äôm quite looking forward to Arnold‚Äôs upcoming ‚Äúchapter 2‚Äù of the story.

One cool example is you can hide API keys from shoulder surfers (and history‚Äôs memory) by storing the key encrypted on disk and using pass to access it at runtime:

                    <span>In 2014 Gerhard joined CloudCredo, a startup co-founded by Colin Humphreys, Paula Kennedy &amp; Chris Hedley. They stuck together through two acquisitions: Pivotal &amp; VMware. This year, Colin, Paula &amp; Chris co-founded Syntasso, the Platform-as-a-Product startup.
Today they all get together to talk about about what it takes to build a platform team, why Team Topologies is a good conversation starter and why a curated blend of off-the-shelf, composed, and self-created services are required in any organisation operating at scale.
Your hunch is right, all of them used to share the same Pivotal London office with Tammer Saleh, our guest from episode 31. Chris used to win all table tennis matches without even breaking a sweat, and today Gerhard gets his comeback. Touch√©!

                    <span>A post from back in June resurfaced this week in light of the big Rails 7 release.
I learned to code in the JavaScript stack and am building a JavaScript based product. I never questioned this stack: many companies default to it, JS everywhere seems good, and the community is big. But for my new side project I decided to try Rails because despite some perception that Ruby on Rails is ‚Äòover‚Äô, people in HN comments say it was somehow more enjoyable than the newer Node based stack. Having tried it I can say wow - coming from the current Javascript ecosystem makes discovering Rails a revelation.
If you make your technology choices because of ‚Äúperception that $TECHNOLOGY is ‚Äòover‚Äô‚Äù, you are missing out on a world of potentially great options.

More than 35,000 Java packages, amounting to over 8% of the Maven Central repository (the most significant Java package repository), have been impacted by the recently disclosed log4j vulnerabilities (1, 2), with widespread fallout across the software industry. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform remote code execution by exploiting the insecure JNDI lookups feature exposed by the logging library log4j. This exploitable feature was enabled by default in many versions of the library.


This vulnerability has captivated the information security ecosystem since its disclosure on December 9th because of both its severity and widespread impact. As a popular logging tool, log4j is used by tens of thousands of s‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>DHH announcing the 7th major release of Ruby on Rails:
This version of Rails has been years in the conceptual making. It‚Äôs the fulfillment of a vision to present a truly full-stack approach to web development that tackles both the front- and back-end challenges with equal vigor. An omakase menu that includes everything from the aperitif to the dessert.
There‚Äôs a lot to like about the new Node-free approach to the frontend, at-work encryption added to Active Record, a new auto-loading strategy, and more. Congrats to the hundreds of contributors who worked on this major milestone!

Mess With DNS gives you a real subdomain, and it‚Äôs running a real DNS server (the address is mess-with-dns1.wizardzines.com). The interesting thing about DNS is that it‚Äôs a global system with many different computers interacting, and so I wanted people to be able to actually see that system in action.

The discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability has set the internet on fire.

Our mission as the Google Open Source Security Team is to secure the open source libraries the world depends on, such as Log4j. One of our capabilities in this space is OSS-Fuzz, a free fuzzing service that is used by over 500 critical open source projects and has found more than 7,000 vulnerabilities in its lifetime.

                    <span>Russ Cox, for the Go team:
Generics are the most significant change to Go since the release of Go 1, and certainly the largest single language change we‚Äôve ever made. With any large, new feature, it is common for new users to discover new bugs, and we don‚Äôt expect generics to be an exception to this rule; be sure to approach them with appropriate caution.
It didn‚Äôt make the headline, but fuzzing (tests that automatically find inputs which cause your program to crash or return invalid answers) also made it in the build, which our Go Time team has been quite excited about as well.

                    <span>The Supabase folks have open sourced a work-in-progress native PostgreSQL extension adding GraphQL support. First, they surveyed the field and liked what they saw from Graphile and Hasura, but‚Ä¶
we host free-tier projects on VMs with 1 GB of memory. After tallying the resources reserved for PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Kong, GoTrue, and a handful of smaller services, we were left with a total memory budget of ‚Ä¶ 0 MB üò¨. Unsurprisingly, our pathological memory target disqualified any option that required launching another process in those VMs.
By their estimates, this effort will reduces the platform‚Äôs memory requirements by 525 TB/hours every month. Seems worth it!

The external security researcher community plays an integral role in making the Google Play ecosystem safe and secure. Through this partnership with the community, Google has been able to collaborate with third-party developers to fix thousands of security issues in Android applications before they are exploited and reward security researchers for their hard work and dedication.  
In order to empower the next generation of Android security researchers, Google has collaborated with industry partners including HackerOne and PayPal to host a number of Android App Hacking Workshops. These workshops are an effort designed to educate security researchers and cybersecurity students of all skill levels ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>We will be working with other ECMA members and the wider JS community on the next iterations of JavaScript, in the TC39 working group. We will be pushing for features and improvements to the language that benefit everyone, but especially users of server-side JavaScript.
Specific features they plan to push forward are better support for non-JS assets in the ES module graph, better support for explicit resource management, and more extensive standard library functions for async iteration. Oh, and this:
As TypeScript is a core part of the Deno ecosystem, we are also very interested in pushing for even closer alignment of TypeScript and JavaScript in the future.

                    <span>A rebuttal by Kailash Nadh to the aforelinked post.
large for-profit corporations started their widespread consumption of FOSS, ever since countless ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù raised infinite amounts of funding on valuations built pretty much entirely on FOSS, ever since FOSS got co-opted into corporatisation and capitalisation. And yet, countless maintainers of critical and widely used FOSS struggle to make a living.
Whose fault is this? I do not believe that this is FOSS‚Äô fault as a conceptual framework or a system. If FOSS was broken, the internet as we know it today wouldn‚Äôt exist; the countless marvels of technology that we take for granted and techno-economies that thrive on them wouldn‚Äôt exist; millions of software developers (like me) who learnt to write code with FOSS and learnt to make a living with that knowledge wouldn‚Äôt exist.

If you want me to make you useful software, pay me. If you use software made by others in their spare time and find it useful, pay them. This should not be a controversial opinion. This should not be a new thing. This should already be the state of the world and it is amazingly horrible for us to have the people that make the things that make our software work at all starve and beg for donations.
The entire article is worth considering.
