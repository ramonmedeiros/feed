                    <span>Any debugging story that includes the phrase, “My Mom’s verbal JIRA ticket was right” has a lot of promise. This one by Jim Nielsen delivers the goods. Here’s the culprit:
In my brain, I always thought of Safari and Chrome as “modern” browsers. But even Chrome, an “evergreen” browser, failed because it wasn‘t on an “evergreen” operating system (or hardware).
and his takeaway:
The real-life impact of our technical decisions really hit home to me once again: my Mom had trouble volunteering and participating in her local community because somebody shipped the optional chaining operator in their production JavaScript.
Be thoughtful out there.

                    <span>At Ace Centre we have just launched an application that uses your webcam to detect when a user blinks. The application then triggers a switch press. This allows users who can’t access a physical switch or eye tracking to communicate using their chosen communication software.
We are really excited about the real world impact EyeCommander is already having and we would love to have more people contributing to the open source codebase
EyeCommander is an Electron app with a React frontend. It uses Mediapipe, which is a collection of pretrained ML models for landmark detection in videos, provided by Google. It is cross platform so you can get up and running on whatever platform you use.

                    <span>Your first thought when reading that headline might’ve been _WebAssembly. Mine was! But no, that is not how Browsix does its thing:
Browsix is a framework that bridges the considerable gap between conventional operating systems and the browser, enabling unmodified programs expecting a Unix-like environment to run directly in the browser. Browsix does this by mapping low-level Unix primitives, like processes and system calls, onto existing browser APIs, like Web Workers and postMessage.
They have examples of this tech enabling a terminal in the browser, a Latex editor, and even a client/server-based meme generator written in JS and Go.

Rust is now replacing parts of the JavaScript web ecosystem like minification (Terser), transpilation (Babel), formatting (Prettier), bundling (webpack), linting (ESLint) and more. Let’s take a deep dive into why this trend is gaining popularity and wider adoption.
We just discussed this topic (and some apprehension about it) on JS Party last week. Definitely a trned worth brushing up on, if you haven’t already.

                    <span>Reshape… automatically handles complex migrations that would normally require downtime or manual multi-step changes. During a migration, Reshape ensures both the old and new schema are available at the same time, allowing you to gradually roll out your application.
Designed for Postgres 12+ and experimental for now. Do not use in production until it shapes up.

In the last year, I’ve talked to ~30 companies in different industries about their challenges with real-time machine learning. I’ve also worked with quite a few to find the solutions. This post outlines the solutions for (1) online prediction and (2) continual learning, with step-by-step use cases, considerations, and technologies required for each level.

                    <span>As a university student, Abigail Annkah fell in love with mathematics, which soon led to her interest in artificial intelligence. After graduating from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Abigail made it through the competitive process to become an AI resident at Google Research, Accra. After her residency, Google offered her a job and she’s now a research software engineer working on several high-profile projects.
As Google grows its presence in Accra, we spoke to Abigail about the mapping project that motivates her, starting a new job while becoming a mother and the importance of inspiring young girls to enter STEM careers.

                    <span>B. Cameron Gain on The New Stack:
Despite an ample amount of documentation and demos made available by Grafana Labs and community members, Grafana can be a challenge to set up (although those that do get its dashboards working generally sing its praises). Many manual configurations and steps are required when installing the different dashboard options. Once installed, many users can be overwhelmed with the number of logs and other data to process for monitoring and observability.
Grafana sure does produce pretty (useful) dashboards 👇, but I do find it overwhelming at times.

                    <span>Martin Heinz on the tools/techniques for finding bottlenecks in your Python code. And fixing them, fast.
The first rule of optimization is to not do it. If you really have to though, then optimize where appropriate. Use the above profiling tools to find bottlenecks, so you don’t waste time optimizing some inconsequential piece of code. It’s also useful to create a reproducible benchmark for the piece of code you’re trying to optimize, so that you can measure the actual improvement.

                    <span>In our first 2022 episode, Alexis Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Weaveworks, is talking to Gerhard about going fully remote, what a great team looks like, and GitOps. While you may have heard of GitOps, now is a good time to check out opengitops.dev.
The most interesting part of today’s conversation is the missing cloud native App Store. While Apple revolutionised the world with the App Store and the iPhone, we don’t yet have something similar for cloud native apps. You may be thinking “But what about OperatorHub?”, or all the Helm registries out there? The registry fragmentation, operator deprecations and lack of curation are not what people have in mind when they think App Store. But there is more to it, so let’s hear how Alexis thinks about this.

                    <span>Back in the olden days, I would just put a mysqldump &gt; dump.sql in a crontab and called it a day. When I started to host more and more stuff with docker, I first just migrated that approach to docker and put it all in a container. That still required me to mess around with config files. Once I started to host postgres containers it all got even more complicated. Thus, I needed a new solution.
I built this tool to make backups easy: Simply point it to a host running docker containers and it will automatically inspect and find all mysql/mariadb and postgres containers and do backups of them on a schedule. No configuration required, it “just works”.

Further this project also provides a tiny convenience command named em to start Emacs server and edit files using Emacs server. This helps in using Emacs efficiently.

                    <span>Previously, we compiled a Go program into a WebAssembly and then converted it into C++ files to make it run on Nintendo Switch. Now, I have succeeded in compiling a Go program into a native binary for Nintendo Switch, and also running a game there. I replaced system calls with C function calls using the -overlay option.

                    <span>Oliver Brotchie developed this CSS fingerprinting technique that requires no Javascript or Cookies to function and avoids anti-tracking methods such as NoScript, VPNs or browser extensions.
CSS Fingerprinting is a technique of tracking and gathering information on site visitors. This method exploits the nature of CSS to track various characteristics about the visitor’s browser and device, which can later be used to either identify or track said visitor.
Right now, at current spec, this method doesn’t scale, but with the next upcoming draft of the CSS specification, CSS Values 4, it will become far more scalable and precise.

                    <span>If you ever get into an “oh snap!” situation where you think you just lost days of work, checkout a dura branch and recover.
Without dura, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state. That’s so 2021. Computers crash and Ctrl-Z only works on files independently. Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can revert to “4 hours ago” instead of “hit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever”. Finally, some sanity.
This sounds a lot like how Fossil works out of the box, except maybe even more paranoid because Fossil will propagate every commit whereas Dura propagates all changes even before they’re committed.

This looks like a fine open source alternative. I’ll give it a try and report back.

                    <span>RSS-Bridge is a PHP project capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don’t have one. It can be used on webservers or as a stand-alone application in CLI mode.
I made a very poor-man’s version of this as my first ever Sinatra app way back in the day. It’s cool to see that vision live on, but it sucks that tools like this have to exist. It seems that the author agrees with me on that:
We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have your service with your applications using your API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.
We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

                    <span>OpenDrop is a command-line tool that allows sharing files between devices directly over Wi-Fi. Its unique feature is that it is protocol-compatible with Apple AirDrop which allows to share files with Apple devices running iOS and macOS.
Super cool, but with a disclaimer: this is the result of reverse engineering the transfer protocol, so the odds of it being flakey (especially as Apple ships OS updates) are high. It’d be rad if Apple would publish an AirDrop-compatible specification for the community to rally around.
You know, like they did with FaceTime. 😉

                    <span>Google’s Quantum AI team has had a productive 2021. Despite ongoing global challenges, we’ve made significant progress in our effort to build a fully error-corrected quantum computer, working towards our next hardware milestone of building an error-corrected quantum bit (qubit) prototype. At the same time, we have continued our commitment to realizing the potential of quantum computers in various applications. That&#x27;s why we published results in top journals, collaborated with researchers across academia and industry, and expanded our team to bring on new talent and expertise.

                    <span>Sara Soueidan is an independent Web UI and design engineer, author, speaker, and trainer from Lebanon. When Sara isn’t offering keynote speeches at conferences (she’s done so a dozen times) she’s writing books like “Codrops CSS Reference” and “Smashing Book 5.” Currently, she’s working on a new course, &quot;Practical Accessibility,&quot; meant to teach devs and designers ways to make their products accessible. In 2015, Sara was voted Developer of the Year in the net awards, and shortlisted for the Outstanding Contribution of the Year award. She also won an O’Reilly Web Platform Award for “exceptional leadership, creativity, and collaboration in the development of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the supporting Web ecosystem.”
We chatted with Sara about front-end web development, the importance of design and her appreciation of birds.

                    <span>Merry Shipmas! This is our special Christmas episode which sums up two months of very early mornings and a few late nights. After many twists and turns, stuff which didn’t work out, as well as pleasant surprises, this is what we ended up with:
🎁 PR #395 - CI/CD Lego set with Guillaume de Rouville &amp; Joel Longtine
🎁 PR #396 - Continuous CPU profiling with Frederic Branczyk
🎁 PR #399 - Auto-restoring Kubernetes clusters with Dan Mangum &amp; Muvaffak Onuş
While we initially intended to have five Christmas presents in total, only three got delivered in time. We planned, worked hard and eventually shipped the best we could just in time for this special Christmas episode. Our hope is that the latest additions to our changelog.com GitHub repository will help you just as much as they will help our …</span>

                    <span>In the summer, Dr. Gino Caspari’s day starts at 5:30 a.m. in Siberia, where he studies the ancient Scythians with the Swiss National Science Foundation. There, he looks for burial places of these nomadic warriors who rode through Asia 2,500 years ago. The work isn’t easy, from dealing with extreme temperatures, to swamps covered with mosquitos. But the biggest challenge is staying one step ahead of tomb raiders.
It’s believed that more than 90% of the tombs — called kurgans — have already been destroyed by raiders looking to profit off what they find, but Gino is looking for the thousands he believes remain scattered across Russia, Mongolia and Western China. To track his progress, he began mapping these burial sites using Google Earth. “There’s a plethora of open data sources out there, b…</span>

                    <span>This is the first (of probably many) “playing with generics” post we’ll see now that Go 1.18 is in beta with official support for the controversial feature.
This post aims to describe my initial experience converting my markphelps/optional library from using code generation to using generics instead. Hopefully, after reading this post you’ll have a better understanding of what generics can do for you and what they can’t.
Mark shares lots of good tips along the way. His findings are quite positive:
I ❤️ that I was able to delete 95% of my code because of generics.
I think that generics will be very beneficial to maintainers who create libraries for things like my own as well as for searching, sorting, transformations, and the like. I can also see some them being extremely helpful for creating well-tested libraries around the various concurrency patterns that are sometimes tricky to get right.

                    <span>Arnold Galovics:
Microservices are getting natural and we almost feel like we’ve been always living in the world of microservices. Lately when I talked to other developers and asked how they would start a greenfield project, almost certainly the answer was, well, one microservice for this, another one for this, another one for user management, one more for authentication, another for authorization, one more for session management, and the list could go on.
I’m gonna try to shed some light on what nobody is talking about when it comes to microservices. And yeah, it’s gonna be a first-hand experience from a past projects I worked on.
This excellent piece gave me some serious deja vu of [Kelsey Hightower’s monoliths are the future. I’m quite looking forward to Arnold’s upcoming “chapter 2” of the story.

                    <span>Turns out the pass command on your local Linux box can be used for a bunch of encryption-related things in addition to what most of us use it for: managing a user’s password.
One cool example is you can hide API keys from shoulder surfers (and history’s memory) by storing the key encrypted on disk and using pass to access it at runtime:
curl -H &quot;API-Key: $(pass provider/api_key)&quot; ...

                    <span>In 2014 Gerhard joined CloudCredo, a startup co-founded by Colin Humphreys, Paula Kennedy &amp; Chris Hedley. They stuck together through two acquisitions: Pivotal &amp; VMware. This year, Colin, Paula &amp; Chris co-founded Syntasso, the Platform-as-a-Product startup.
Today they all get together to talk about about what it takes to build a platform team, why Team Topologies is a good conversation starter and why a curated blend of off-the-shelf, composed, and self-created services are required in any organisation operating at scale.
Your hunch is right, all of them used to share the same Pivotal London office with Tammer Saleh, our guest from episode 31. Chris used to win all table tennis matches without even breaking a sweat, and today Gerhard gets his comeback. Touché!

                    <span>A post from back in June resurfaced this week in light of the big Rails 7 release.
I learned to code in the JavaScript stack and am building a JavaScript based product. I never questioned this stack: many companies default to it, JS everywhere seems good, and the community is big. But for my new side project I decided to try Rails because despite some perception that Ruby on Rails is ‘over’, people in HN comments say it was somehow more enjoyable than the newer Node based stack. Having tried it I can say wow - coming from the current Javascript ecosystem makes discovering Rails a revelation.
If you make your technology choices because of “perception that $TECHNOLOGY is ‘over’”, you are missing out on a world of potentially great options.

More than 35,000 Java packages, amounting to over 8% of the Maven Central repository (the most significant Java package repository), have been impacted by the recently disclosed log4j vulnerabilities (1, 2), with widespread fallout across the software industry. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform remote code execution by exploiting the insecure JNDI lookups feature exposed by the logging library log4j. This exploitable feature was enabled by default in many versions of the library.


This vulnerability has captivated the information security ecosystem since its disclosure on December 9th because of both its severity and widespread impact. As a popular logging tool, log4j is used by tens of thousands of s…</span>

This version of Rails has been years in the conceptual making. It’s the fulfillment of a vision to present a truly full-stack approach to web development that tackles both the front- and back-end challenges with equal vigor. An omakase menu that includes everything from the aperitif to the dessert.
There’s a lot to like about the new Node-free approach to the frontend, at-work encryption added to Active Record, a new auto-loading strategy, and more. Congrats to the hundreds of contributors who worked on this major milestone!

                    <span>Julia Evans has a cool new web tool for experimenting with DNS. She wrote up why she created it and some of the tech behind the tool on her announcement post:
Mess With DNS gives you a real subdomain, and it’s running a real DNS server (the address is mess-with-dns1.wizardzines.com). The interesting thing about DNS is that it’s a global system with many different computers interacting, and so I wanted people to be able to actually see that system in action.

The discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability has set the internet on fire. Similar to shellshock and heartbleed, Log4Shell is just the latest catastrophic vulnerability in software that runs the internet. Our mission as the Google Open Source Security Team is to secure the open source libraries the world depends on, such as Log4j. One of our capabilities in this space is OSS-Fuzz, a free fuzzing service that is used by over 500 critical open source projects and has found more than 7,000 vulnerabilities in its lifetime. 
We want to empower open source developers to secure their code on their own. Over the next year we will work on better automated detection of non-memory corruption vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell. We have star…</span>

With any large, new feature, it is common for new users to discover new bugs, and we don’t expect generics to be an exception to this rule; be sure to approach them with appropriate caution.
It didn’t make the headline, but fuzzing (tests that automatically find inputs which cause your program to crash or return invalid answers) also made it in the build, which our Go Time team has been quite excited about as well.

                    <span>The Supabase folks have open sourced a work-in-progress native PostgreSQL extension adding GraphQL support. First, they surveyed the field and liked what they saw from Graphile and Hasura, but…
we host free-tier projects on VMs with 1 GB of memory. After tallying the resources reserved for PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Kong, GoTrue, and a handful of smaller services, we were left with a total memory budget of … 0 MB 😬. Unsurprisingly, our pathological memory target disqualified any option that required launching another process in those VMs.
By their estimates, this effort will reduces the platform’s memory requirements by 525 TB/hours every month. Seems worth it!
