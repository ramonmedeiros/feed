In addition, this post will cover some other improvements we’ve made to Parcel since our last update, along with our roadmap to a stable Parcel 2 release.
A growing trend in the JS tooling world is to replace bits and pieces with Rust || Go where it makes sense and reap the performance benefits. Congrats to the Parcel team…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It’s great to be back hosting our I/O Developers Conference this year. Pulling up to our Mountain View campus this morning, I felt a sense of normalcy for the first time in a long while. Of course, it’s not the same without our developer community here in person. COVID-19 has deeply affected our entire global community over the past year and continues to take a toll. Places such as Brazil, and my home country of India, are now going through their most difficult moments of the pandemic yet. Our thoughts are …</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help clinicians care for patients and treat disease — from improving the screening process for breast cancer to helping detect tuberculosis more efficiently. When we combine these advances in AI with other technologies, like smartphone cameras, we can unlock new ways for people to stay better informed about their health, too.

                <p>Today we’re sharing new AI research that aims to improve screening for one of the top causes of death worldwide: tuberculosis (TB). TB infects 10 million people per year and disproportionately affects people in low-to-middle-income countries. Diagnosing TB early is difficult because its symptoms can mimic those of common respiratory diseases.
Cost-effective screening, specifically chest X-rays, has been identified as one way to improve the screening process. However, experts aren’t always available to inter…</p>

Go had a crazy month in April 2018 &amp; TypeScript’s TODOs exploded in the Spring of 2018.

Good app structure improves the developer experience. It can help you isolate what they are working on without needing to keep the entire codebase in your head. A well structured app can help prevent bugs by decoupling components and making it easier to write useful tests.

Jeff now leads Cobalt Speech and Language, and he was kind enough to join us for a discussion about human computer interaction, multimodal AI tasks, the history of language modeling, and AI for social good.

This week, a friend shared a blog post that critiqued a popular framework for CSS. Twitter started to discuss if it’s okay to criticise tools. In this post, I’ll say it is not just okay, it is also important.
This is a tough subject because we identify so closely with the things we create (our code), but Hidde is right: if we want to progress as an industry (and individually) we need to be able to criticize (constructively) …</p>

                <p>Posted by Ivan Lozano, Android Team

The Android team has been working on introducing the Rust programming language into the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) since 2019 as a memory-safe alternative for platform native code development. As with any large project, introducing a new language requires careful consideration. For Android, one important area was assessing how to best fit Rust into Android’s build system. Currently this means the Soong build system (where the Rust support resides), but these desi…</p>

The how is also super interesting:

Many great Phoenix LiveView examples exist. They often show the ease and power of LiveView but stop at multiple browsers talking to a single web server.

Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they’re proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they’re proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don’t. And if they have deep domain expertise, that’s probably the source of it.

I always found myself spending too much time styling and layouting slides when using apps like PowerPoint / Keynote / Google Slides. Whenever I need to share code snippets, I would also need to use other tools to generate the highlighted code as images over and over again.
So as a frontend developer, why not solve it the way that fits better with what I am good at?
Looks slick: themeable, hackable, and you write your slides in Markdown. 👌

                <p>Any git repository may contain tons of information about commits, contributors, and files. Extracting this information is not always trivial, mostly because there are a gadzillion options to a gadzillion git commands – I don’t think there is a single person alive who knows them all. Probably not even Linus Torvalds himself :).

                <p>David Cassel, on The New Stack:
Widely-respected security expert Dan Kaminsky passed away on April 23 from diabetic ketoacidosis at the age of 42. His considerable legacy went beyond expertise with a rare and memorable kindness.
I met Dan very briefly at ShmooCon back in 2004. His kindness was memorable, for sure, but the thing I remember most was just how larger-than-life he was to me at the time. The guy contributed so much to the infosec community and yet remained humble and kind despite it all. It was s…</p>

It’s part of a “GitHub as Stack” meta-trend
It promotes RSS, which is one of the web’s great treasures

                <p>What does “developer productivity” mean to you?
At face value, when we think of developer productivity we might think of effectiveness in time management, communication, and task completion. Although we are drawn to personal workflow or time management tools, and learning secrets to improving our productivity, ironically this quest for the holy grail can sometimes take us off course and be a detriment to our productivity. … As a developer of scientific software, and one who has transitioned to working remot…</p>

We go down the NFT rabbit hole on a very technical level and we come out the other side with clarity and a compelling use of NFTs.

                <p>High-profile entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, venture capitalists like Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, and big companies like Oracle and HP Enterprise are all leaving California. During COVID-19, Zoom-enabled tech workers have discovered the benefits of remote work from cheaper, less congested communities elsewhere. Is this the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? Perhaps. But other challenges to Silicon Valley’s preeminence are more fundamental than the tech diaspora.

                <p>Brett Cannon, who is a Python core developer (and a tall, snarky Canadian):
I felt it was time to do another blog post to directly address the issue of entitlement by some open source users which is hurting open source, both for themselves and for others. I want to get the point across that open source maintainers owe you quite literally nothing when it comes to their open source code, and treating them poorly is unethical. And to me, this is the underlying social contract of open source. (emphasis added)

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Mongita is a lightweight embedded document database that implements a commonly-used subset of the MongoDB/PyMongo interface. Mongita differs from MongoDB in that instead of being a server, Mongita is a self-contained Python library.  Mongita can be configured to store its documents either on disk or in memory.
I can’t speak to the implementation, but I love the idea behind this project. Already know and love Mongo? Here’s a way to use it in an embedded fashion with all of the advantages that come with such …</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>This is an excellent article about understanding technical debt:
It is a fact that, over time, all development teams get slowed down by the existing codebase. But why? Is it because maintenance is inevitable? Or because we could do something better in the first place? Or both?
Luca argues that technical debt is introduced as a by-product of disagreement, which itself is a by-product of two phenomena: wrong design, and rapid evolution. Thoughtful stuff. Well worth your time.

                <p>Oli Larkin:
This is a curated list of my favourite music DSP and audio programming resources. It was originally meant to be an official “Awesome list”, but apparently you are not meant to write in the first person, so it is now a “more awesome” list.
I’m still giving this the awesome topic, despite his first person point of view. Oli is a long-time audio programmer, so he’s well positioned to curate a list like this one.
