                    <span>The panel dives into a topic that makes most software developers cringe: Professional networking. Starting with a definition - what does it even mean? - they go into hacks they’ve found for getting more comfortable with networking, building your network in person or online, and then using your network to find new job opportunities or consulting work.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Cory Doctorow (this episode contains explicit language) about his newest book Chokepoint Capitalism, which he co-autored with Rebecca Giblin. Chokepoint Capitalism is about how big tech and big content have captured creative labor markets and the ways we can win them back. We talk about chokepoints creating chickenized reverse-centaurs, paying for your robot boss (think Uber, Doordash, Amazon Drivers), the chickenization that’s climbing the priviledge gradient from the most blue collar workers to the middle-class. There are chokepoints in open source, AI generative art, interoperability, music, film, and media. To quote Cory, “We’re all fighting the same fight.”

High profile open source vulnerabilities have made it clear that securing the supply chains underpinning modern software is an urgent, yet enormous, undertaking. As supply chains get more complicated, enterprise developers need to manage the tidal wave of vulnerabilities that propagate up through dependency trees. Open source maintainers need streamlined ways to vet proposed dependencies and protect their projects. A rise in attacks coupled with increasingly complex supply chains means that supply chain security problems need solutions on the ecosystem level. 


One way developers can manage this enormous risk is by choosing a more secure language. As part of Google’s commitment to advancing…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Jesper Sarnesjo and Nicky Ringland, Google Open Source Security Team


Today, we are excited to announce the deps.dev API, which provides free access to the deps.dev dataset of security metadata, including dependencies, licenses, advisories, and other critical health and security signals for more than 50 million open source package versions.


Software supply chain attacks are increasingly common and harmful, with high profile incidents such as Log4Shell, Codecov, and the recent 3CX hack. The overwhelming complexity of the software ecosystem causes trouble for even the most diligent and well-resourced developers.

                    <span>Andy Baio with the eagle eyes 🦅
While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.
I’ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them. The file is found in every version of macOS from Mojave (10.14.0) to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isn’t in High Sierra (10.13) or earlier.
Well that’s a fun bit of trivia! But why?
Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? The filename is “simpledoc.pdf” and it’s only 184 KB. Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.

                    <span>Mat &amp; Johnny interview everyone’s favorite LLM (Natalie with a special hat on) to see if it’d make a good hire as a Go dev. Also, Mat tries to turn it into his very own creepy robot by asking personal questions about his co-hosts. Things get weird. In a good way?

                    <span>Courtland Allen:
Exactly six years ago (to the day!), Stripe acquired Indie Hackers to help us grow and inspire millions of people building online businesses.
Today, I’m happy to announce that @channingallen and I are indie hackers again!
So what now?
Well, if we want to survive and thrive, we’re going to have to generate revenue just like any other business! I’m an entrepreneur at heart and always have been. In fact, working at Stripe was my first and only salaried job.
Right now we’re sitting at exactly $0 in MRR, so the journey is just now (re)starting.
Welcome back to the club, guys! Exciting times 💯

                    <span>+10x engineers may be mythical, but -10x engineers exist. To become a -10x engineer, simply waste 400 engineering hours per week. Combine the following strategies:
I know the 10x developer is a myth and all, but one thing we don’t talk about very often is that it is sometimes easy to out-pace other devs simply by moving forward at a decent clip.
This is because there are easy (yet non-obvious) ways to make negative progress as a developer. It’s not hard to move orders of magnitude faster than someone who’s headed in the wrong direction.

You prepare the CLI commands you want to run to best showcase what you’ve built, but then you waste time typing long commands; you make typos; the commands fail or take way too long to complete. Maybe they depend on external system (network, APIs, cloud, …) and of course it’s not cooperating while you’re running your live demo.
Here’s how you can avoid all of the above by scripting, automating and recording your demos, so that you never have to stress about showcasing ever again…

few  patches that completely removed XUL layout from the Firefox codebase.


 This means that (modulo a few exceptions documented below) all the Firefox UI is using regular web technology to render (mostly CSS flexbox).


 This was a rather big effort (first filed 9 years ago in bug 1033225), and I wanted to document some of the things that I learned during the process, some of the things and decisions that made it possible, and some of the things that I would’ve maybe done differently.

GitHub private repos lull us into lazy thinking.
We cram our secrets into git, then shove it off to the most expansive code forge in the history of humanity, and most of the time: everything’s fine.
But GitHub’s ssh host key leak last week demonstrates that private repos are, at best, private-ish.

                    <span>Alex Schepanovski:
I always thought of 1+N as a thing that you just keep in your head, catch on code reviews or via performance regressions. This worked well for a long time, however, the less control we have over our SQL queries the more likely it will sneak through those guards…
I tumbled on a couple of 1+Ns while reading a project code for an unrelated reason and it got me thinking – do I ever want Django to do that lazy loading stuff? And the answer was never.
Turns out the implementation of this is quite easy. ~15 loc for the naive version and ~35 for a more robust version. Give it a try if you, like Alex, never want to allow a 1+N in your Django app again.

                    <span>This open letter by the Future of Life institute has been signed by 1380 people (so far) including notable technologists such as Steve Wozniak, Stuart Russell, Emad Mostaque (Stability AI) &amp; Elon Musk.
Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable. This confidence must be well justified and increase with the magnitude of a system’s potential effects. OpenAI’s recent statement regarding artificial general intelligence, states that “At some point, it may be important to get independent review before starting to train future systems, and for the most advanced efforts to agree to limit the rate of growth of compute used for creating new models.” We agree. That point is now.
Therefore, we call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4. This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.

                    <span>Design handoffs are inefficient and painful. They cause frustration, friction and a lot of back and forth. Can we avoid them altogether? Of course we can! Let’s see how to do just that.

                    <span>We are seeing an explosion of AI apps that are (at their core) a thin UI on top of calls to OpenAI generative models. What risks are associated with this sort of approach to AI integration, and is explainability and accountability something that can be achieved in chat-based assistants?
Beth Rudden of Bast.ai has been thinking about this topic for some time and has developed an ontological approach to creating conversational AI. We hear more about that approach and related work in this episode.

                    <span>ALOHA stands for “A Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation”, which is certainly a stretch in terms of acronym, but the project itself is so cool that I don’t think it really matters… Here’s the pitch:
Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface.

We were searching for something like FastAPI for Kafka-based service we were developing, but couldn’t find anything similar. So we shamelessly made one by reusing beloved paradigms from FastAPI and we shamelessly named it FastKafka.
The point was to set the expectations right - you get pretty much what you would expect: function decorators for consumers and producers with type hints specifying Pydantic classes for JSON encoding/decoding, automatic message routing to Kafka brokers and documentation generation.

I like how it uses code snippets from popular projects. I don’t like how slow I am at writing Rust code! 🤣

                    <span>Steve Yegge is very excited about LLMs and thinks the rest of us should be as well:
There is something legendary and historic happening in software engineering, right now as we speak, and yet most of you don’t realize at all how big it is.
LLMs aren’t just the biggest change since social, mobile, or cloud–they’re the biggest thing since the World Wide Web. And on the coding front, they’re the biggest thing since IDEs and Stack Overflow, and may well eclipse them both.
Steve’s been in the industry a long time. He worked at Amazon back when AWS was just a demo on some engineer’s laptop and he worked at Google when Kubernetes was just a demo on some engineer’s laptop.
The point: when Steve Yegge gets excited about something it probably means more than when most people get excited about something.

We were just discussing Apple’s next AI move on yesterday’s JS Party live (ships to the feed next Friday). They’ve been the quietest tech giant since the GenAI movement kicked in to high gear. My guess: they’ll have a LOT to say at this June’s WWDC…

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Georgi Gerganov about his work on Whisper.cpp and llama.cpp. Georgi first crossed our radar with whisper.cpp, his port of OpenAI’s Whisper model in C and C++. Whisper is a speech recognition model enabling audio transcription and translation. Something we’re paying close attention to here at Changelog, for obvious reasons. Between the invite and the show’s recording, he had a new hit project on his hands: llama.cpp. This is a port of Facebook’s LLaMA model in C and C++. Whisper.cpp made a splash, but llama.cpp is growing in GitHub stars faster than Stable Diffusion did, which was a rocket ship itself.

                    <span>Josh Comeau:
Over the past few months, I’ve spoken with lots of early-career devs who are getting more and more anxious about AI. They’ve seen the increasingly-impressive demos from tools like GPT-4, and they worry that by the time they’re fluent in HTML/CSS/JS, there won’t be any jobs left for them.
I couldn’t disagree more. I don’t think web developer jobs are going anywhere. And I’m getting pretty sick of the FUD? being spread online.
So, in this blog post, I’m going to share my hypothesis for what will happen. Things are going to change, but not in the scary way people are saying.

Some people use it because of its small size, some because of habit and some, just because they copy-pasted a Dockerfile from some tutorial. Yet, there are plenty of reasons why you should not use Alpine for your container images, some of which can cause you great amount of grief…
