                    <span>Jerod’s Note: The short embedded below of Tammer Saleh on Ship It! created a firestorm of comments from folks who were unsatisfied with the lack of explanation behind his conclusion.

  
I caught up with Tammer at KubeCon NA 2023 and took the opportunity to ask him to clarify and defend the comment. This post is a fancied-up transcript of his response.
It’s better in audio where I read him some comments &amp; we all have a good laugh. Play the audio.
NixOS has one fatal flaw, which is the usability of Nix.
(By the way, I really do love the passion in the Nix community. They created that, right? They created those comments. But Nix does have that fatal flaw of a really horrible learning curve  and user experience.)

During the episode, we cover the key categories to think about as you try to navigate the open source AI ecosystem, and Casper gives his thoughts on fine-tuning, vector DBs &amp; more.

Android’s defense-in-depth strategy applies not only to the Android OS running on the Application Processor (AP) but also the firmware that runs on devices. We particularly prioritize hardening the cellular baseband given its unique combination of running in an elevated privilege and parsing untrusted inputs that are remotely delivered into the device.


This post covers how to use two high-value sanitizers which can prevent specific classes of vulnerabilities found within the baseband.

                    <span>This week on The Changelog we’re joined by Drew DeVault, talking about the Hare programming language. From the website, Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable, and robust. When we asked Drew why he credted it, he said “[because] I wanted it to exist, and it did not exist.” Wise words.
Hare aims to be a 100 year language (which we get into on the show), why he’s so possionate about all things open source, the state of the language, fostering a culture that values stability, and oddly enough — what it takes to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.

Have you ever seen huge exception-handling blocks? Here is an example. Let&#x27;s assume we are calling bakePizza() to bake a pizza, and it can be overbaked, throwing a PizzaOverbakedException.




class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};


void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};


try {
  // 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
  ...
  bakePizza();
  // Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.
  ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new IllegalStateException(); // Root cause ignored while throwing new exception.
}



Here are the problems with the above code:

Obscuring the logic. The method bakePizza(), is obscured by the additional lines of code of preparation and delivery, so unintended exceptions from preparation and delivery may be caught.
Catching the general exception. catch (Exception e) will catch everything, despite that we might only want to handle PizzaOverbakedException here.
Rethrowing a general exception, with the original exception ignored. This means that the root cause is lost - we don&#x27;t know what exactly goes wrong with pizza baking while debugging.

Here is a better alternative, rewritten to avoid the problems above.



class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};

void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};

// 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
...
try {
  bakePizza();
} catch (PizzaOverbakedException e) {  // Other exceptions won’t be caught.
  // Rethrow a more meaningful exception; so that we know pizza is overbaked.
  throw new IllegalStateException(“You burned the pizza!”, e);  
}
// Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.

                    <span>In this enlightening episode, we delve deeper than the usual buzz surrounding AI’s perils, focusing instead on the tangible problems emerging from the use of machine learning algorithms across Europe. We explore “suspicion machines” — systems that assign scores to welfare program participants, estimating their likelihood of committing fraud. Join us as Justin and Gabriel share insights from their thorough investigation, which involved gaining access to one of these models and meticulously analyzing its behavior.

Systems such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Play rely on text classification models to identify harmful content including phishing attacks, inappropriate comments, and scams. These types of texts are harder for machine learning models to classify because bad actors rely on adversarial text manipulations to actively attempt to evade the classifiers.

The book Clean Code discusses a camping rule that is good to keep in the back of your mind when writing code:



Leave the campground cleaner than you found it



So how does that fit into software development? The thinking is this: When you make changes to code that can potentially be improved, try to make it just a little bit better.

                    <span>This week on we’re joined by Emil Sjölander from Figma — talking about bringing Dev Mode to Figma. Dev Mode is their new workspace in Figma that’s designed to bring developers and design to the same tool.
The question they’re trying to answer is “How do you create a home for developers in a design tool?” We go way back to Emil’s startup that was acquired by Figma called Visly, how we iterated to here from 20 years ago (think PSD &gt; HTML days), what they did to build Dev Mode, what they’re doing around codegen, the popularity of design systems, and what it takes to go from zero to Dev Mode.
