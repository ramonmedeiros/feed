Shell scripts (including Bash scripts) can be convenient for automating simple command line procedures, and they are often better than keeping complicated commands in a single developer&#x27;s history. However, shell scripts can be hard to understand and maintain, and are typically not as well-supported as other programming languages. Shell scripts have less support for unit testing, and there is likely a lower chance that somebody reading one will be experienced with the language.

This tool, awarded the Gold Prize during Google‚Äôs internal Security &amp; AI Hackathon, allows developers to create or modify security policies using simple English instructions rather than having to learn system-specific syntax or complex security principles.

                    <span>Posted by Andrew Walbran, Android Rust Team


moving native code in Android from C++ to Rust has resulted in fewer security vulnerabilities. Most of the components we mentioned then were system services in userspace (running under Linux), but these are not the only components typically written in memory-unsafe languages. Many security-critical components of an Android system run in a ‚Äúbare-metal‚Äù environment, outside of the Linux kernel, and these are historically written in C. As part of our efforts to harden firmware on Android devices, we are increasingly using Rust in these bare-metal environments too.


To that end, we have rewritten the Android Virtualization Framework‚Äôs protected VM (pVM) firmware in Rust to provide a memory safe foundation for the pVM root of trust. This firmware p‚Ä¶</span>

In 2020, we launched a novel format for our vulnerability reward program (VRP) with the kCTF VRP and its continuation kernelCTF. For the first time, security researchers could get bounties for n-day exploits even if they didn‚Äôt find the vulnerability themselves. This format proved valuable in improving our understanding of the most widely exploited parts of the linux kernel. Its success motivated us to expand it to new areas and we&#x27;re now excited to announce that we&#x27;re extending it to two new targets: v8CTF and kvmCTF.





Today, we&#x27;re launching v8CTF, a CTF focused on V8, the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome. kvmCTF is an upcoming CTF focused on Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) that will be released later in the year.‚Ä¶</span>

When addressing comments for your code reviewed by colleagues, find a solution that makes both you and the reviewer happy. The fact that a reviewer left a comment suggests you may be able to improve the code further. Here are two effective ways to respond:

                    <span>What is the model lifecycle like for experimenting with and then deploying generative AI models?

Chris and Daniel give a high level overview in this effort and discuss model optimization and serving.

Android 14 is the third major Android release with Rust support. We are already seeing a number of benefits:



Productivity: Developers quickly feel productive writing Rust. They report important indicators of development velocity, such as confidence in the code quality and ease of code review.

Security: There has been a reduction in memory safety vulnerabilities as we shift more development to memory safe languages.



These positive early results provided an enticing motivation to increase the speed and scope of Rust adoption. We hoped to accomplish this by investing heavily in training to expand from the early adopters.

My spicy take is that XML is better than YAML, because there are situations where XML is appropriate, but there‚Äôs no situation where YAML is appropriate.
Johnny Boursiquot: Dang. Shots fired! ü§£
Let‚Äôs talk about XML first
So, XML got a really bad reputation. The reason it got a really bad reputation is because people were using it for things that it should never have been used for. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. And if you‚Äôre using it as an extensible markup language, it‚Äôs actually really great.

In Steve‚Äôs post Why Open Source Matters, he says ‚Äúopen source is at a crossroads‚Äù and there are some seeking to break the definition of open source to one that is more permissive to their desires, and they are closer than ever to achieving that goal. Today‚Äôs conversation goes deep on this subject.

Introduction

In December 2022, Google‚Äôs Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered an in-the-wild exploit chain targeting Samsung Android devices. TAG‚Äôs blog post covers the targeting and the actor behind the campaign. This is a technical analysis of the final stage of one of the exploit chains, specifically CVE-2023-0266 (a 0-day in the ALSA compatibility layer) and CVE-2023-26083 (a 0-day in the Mali GPU driver) as well as the techniques used by the attacker to gain kernel arbitrary read/write access.

Notably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities:


CVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a &quot;Chrome n-day&quot;), was used to achieve RCE.


CVE-2022-3038, another Chrome n-‚Ä¶</span>
