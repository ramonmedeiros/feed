                    <span>Jean Yang:
Should you move to serverless? Is GraphQL the answer to your API woes? Should you follow the latest DevOps playbook to increase your system reliability? In the world of tech tools, there‚Äôs a lot of buzz. But it doesn‚Äôt always reflect the daily reality of programmers.
As the founder of a developer tools startup, I‚Äôve talked with hundreds, if not thousands, of software developers over the last few years in the course of routine user research. The common theme in these conversations, even bigger than the need for the product we were building, was an overarching need that is currently underserved: building for real developers, or what I like to call the 99% Developers.
Good stuff to be reminded of. That reminds me: You are not Google/Amazon/LinkedIn.

When you hear the phrase ‚Äúcloud native,‚Äù is Kubernetes the first thing that comes to your mind? It is for me, and I expect I‚Äôm not alone. Kubernetes is now the second-largest open source project after Linux, and it‚Äôs the big fish in the cloud native pond. But there are many other projects in the CNCF landscape and the broader cloud native community.
So, I thought I‚Äôd list some cloud native tools that can be very useful for teams that aren‚Äôt using Kubernetes or aren‚Äôt using it for every workload. Here are 7 of them that I like a lot.
If Rich‚Äôs name rings a bell, that‚Äôs because he was just on Ship It! last week. üòâ

As organizations deploy code faster than ever, implementing continuous security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is critical to building secure products. As a long-time HackerOne Bounty customer, GitLab knows the importance of identifying and addressing bugs as early as possible in the SDLC. We wanted to hear what they had to say about leveraging the human intelligence of ethical hackers to broadly test their attack surface and increase their ability to resist potential threats.</span>

                    <span>It‚Äôs possible to pair well simply by avoiding pairing poorly.
I‚Äôve never thought about it that way, but yeah, makes sense. What follows is a list of things not to do when pairing. Things for navigators, things for drivers, and things for both.
This is just one page from Tuple‚Äôs pair programming guide, which looks excellent all-around.

This project have started as an experiment to discover generics implementation. It may look like Lodash in some aspects. I used to code with the awesome go-funk package, but it uses reflection and therefore is not typesafe.
As expected, benchmarks demonstrate that generics will be much faster than implementations based on reflect stdlib package. Benchmarks also shows similar performances to pure for loops.

                    <span>This week we have the pleasure of Rich Burroughs, Senior Developer Advocate at Loft Labs and host of the Kube Cuddle podcast.
We talk about multitenancy in Kubernetes and how to run Kubernetes in Kubernetes with vcluster. If you are using KiND, you will find this episode interesting, and maybe even helpful.
We also talk about the role that Kelsey Hightower played in Rich joining the CNCF ecosystem. The key take-away is that people make all the difference.
ADHD is something that Rich thinks about often. Gerhard was curious about the difference between ADHD and burnout, as well as this Twitter thread on re-reading sent emails.

# @arg target!                      File to upload
upload() {
    echo &quot;cmd                       upload&quot;
    echo &quot;arg:  target              $argc_target&quot;
}

Then you trust Argc to parse that and do the heavy lifting:
eval &quot;$(argc -e $0 &quot;$@&quot;)&quot;

The only drawback (aside from potential parsing bugs) to this approach is your script now depends on having argc in the machine‚Äôs executable path. i.e. ‚Äì¬†it‚Äôs not portable.
What‚Äôd be even cooler, IMHO, would be to instead use argc as a pre-processor of sorts that spits out a pure-bash implementation from your input script. Regardless, a cool idea!

                    <span>Chris Ferdinandi:
For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that‚Äôs nonsense. Let‚Äôs dig in!
I built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I‚Äôve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.
Heck, even Chris‚Äôs disclaimer of ‚Äòwhen SPAs make sense‚Äô section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation. But I digress‚Ä¶ read this post it‚Äôs a good one for sure.

                    <span>Writing high quality standards is a necessary first step to an interoperable web platform, but ensuring that browsers are consistent in their behavior requires an ongoing process. Browsers must work to ensure that they have a shared understanding of web standards, and that their implementation matches that understanding.
Interop 2022 is a cross-browser initiative to find and address the most important interoperability pain points on the web platform. The end result is a public metric that will assess progress toward fixing these interoperability issues.

                    <span>DNA is the language of life: our DNA forms a living record of things that went well for our ancestors, and things that didn‚Äôt. DNA tells our body (and every other organism) which proteins to produce; these proteins are tiny machines that carry out enormous tasks, from fighting off infection to helping you ace an upcoming exam in school.


But for about a third of all proteins that all organisms produce, we just don‚Äôt know what they do. It‚Äôs kind of like we‚Äôre in a factory where everything‚Äôs buzzing, and we‚Äôre surrounded by all these impressive tools, but we have only a vague idea of what‚Äôs going on. Understanding how these tools operate, and how we can use them, is where we think machine learning can make a big difference.

A new storage engine for PostgreSQL, bringing a modern approach to database capacity, capabilities and performance to the world‚Äôs most-loved database platform.
OrioleDB consists of an extension, building on the innovative table access method framework and other standard Postgres extension interfaces. By extending and enhancing the current table access methods, OrioleDB opens the door to a future of more powerful storage models that are optimized for cloud and modern hardware architectures.

While working on the frontlines of open source, Feross and team have witnessed firsthand how supply chain attacks have swept across the software community and have damaged the trust in open source. Socket turns the problem of securing open source software on its head, and asks‚Ä¶‚ÄúWhat if we assume all open source may be malicious?‚Äù So, they built a system that proactively detects indicators of compromised open source packages and brings awareness to teams in real-time. We cover the whys, the hows, and what‚Äôs next for this ambitious and very much needed project.

Yes‚Ä¶ we said tractors, as in farming! This is a super cool discussion about MLOps solutions at scale for interesting use cases in agriculture.

                    <span>Almond.CSS helps in two ways: it normalizes the CSS styles to provide similar experience cross-browser, and it spices things a little by adding custom styles (that can be personalized!)
Use the different HTML5 semantic tags on your website, include the library in your project, and let CSS and the browser work their magic. Just combine your HTML and Almond CSS (no JavaScript needed.)
Demo here. Looks like a great starter for simple side projects and the like.

For a software engineer, the hardest thing about developing Machine Learning functionality should be finding clean and representative ground-truth data, but it often isn‚Äôt. If you already have a source of good quality data (perhaps because it is already gathered by your application), here are some obstacles that still lay ahead of you
From the difficult to grasp concepts to the varied (and variable quality) software you‚Äôll need to explore and manage the data, there‚Äôs still a lot of obstacles in our path before we can put a model to good use.

It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to build APIs that solve today‚Äôs problems while anticipating an unknown future. In some cases, I think the original CSS authors did precisely that.

                    <span>ngrok rocks, but it‚Äôs 2nd version is famously closed source*, so many open source alternatives have been developed over the years. So many, in fact, that they now have their own awesome list.
The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS, even if behind a NAT or other restricted network.
*We spoke with Alan Shreve about this decision back when he made it, if you‚Äôre curious about his thinking.

I think I‚Äôve come up with a novel hack for the challenge of getting your company to financially support the open source projects that it uses: reach out to the maintainers and offer them generous speaking fees for remote talks to your engineering team.
It won‚Äôt work for every person and situation, but we should add it to our arsenal of ways to return economic value back to the maintainers of our open source infrastructure.

Mauricio is a Staff Engineer at VMware where he spends most of his time contributing to Knative, an open source platform for running serverless workloads on Kubernetes. Gerhard &amp; Mauricio spent a few months in 2021 working on Knative Eventing, and they both appreciate shipping great software continuously. Mauricio helped ship Knative 1.0.
The from-monolith-to-k8s application used throughout this book has been a few years in the making. It doubles-up as a workshop-style guide for rearchitecting a Java monolith to a Cloud Native architecture running in Kubernetes.

Linux kernel support for the 32-bit ARM architecture was contributed in the late 90s, when there was little corporate involvement in Linux development, and most contributors were students or hobbyists, tinkering with development boards, often without much in the way of documentation.


Now 20+ years later, 32-bit ARM&#x27;s maintainer has downgraded its support level to &#x27;odd fixes,&#x27; while remaining active as a kernel contributor. This is a common pattern for aging and obsolete architectures: corporate funding for Linux kernel development has tremendously increased the pace of development, but only for architectures with a high return on investment. As a result, the 32-bit ARM port of Linux is essentially in maintenance-only mode, and ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Knut Melv√¶r with a thoughtful attack on one of my all-time favorite tools:
Markdown is a signifier for the developer and text-tinkerer culture. But since its introduction, the world of digital content has also changed. While Markdown is still fine for some things, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs should be the go-to for content anymore.
There are two main reasons for this:
Markdown wasn‚Äôt designed to meet today‚Äôs needs of content.
Markdown holds editorial experience back.
Now, I did say it‚Äôs a thoughtful atttack and it‚Äôs also a long one (30 minute read). Knut does the work, diving deep into Markdown‚Äôs history and John Gruber‚Äôs desires for it:
I want to build my advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web. For many of us, I suspect Markdown is something we just take for granted as a ‚Äúthing that exists.‚Äù But all technology has a history and is a product of human interaction. This is important to remember when you, the reader, develop technology for others to use.

                    <span>Why create another form library? Here‚Äôs what Fomir‚Äôs author says to that:
I have tried many form libraries, like redux-form, formik, final-form, react-hook-form‚Ä¶ None of them suit my taste. I would expect a forms library with these features:
Using schema
Easy to update form state
High Performance
More abstract
Fomir create form by passing a form schema which is a JSON tree. the form schema is very flexible, you can create any form by the schema.
I could see this as especially useful for form builders and similar tools where you‚Äôre providing a graphical way to build forms because your backend would just have to emit the correct JSON and let Fomir take it from there.

                    <span>Douglas Vaghetti:
It is a good time to be in tech right now: soaring salaries, daily LinkedIn recruiter spam, people bootcamping their way into career switches to tech, remote work allowing you to work for a major tech company making triple digit salaries from the beach. It really feels like every single company is trying to recruit programmers nowadays, and doing whatever they can to get them.
I‚Äôm certainly happy with the current state of affairs, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder: How does it end?
Will supply go up via a mass influx of people switching careers? Will demand go down via AI and newly created no-code/low-code alternatives? Time will tell. But for now, some food for thought.

                    <span>Jujutsu (jj at your CLI) combines features from popular distributed version controls systems (Git, Mercurial, Darcs) with features not found in any of them, such as:
working-copy-as-commit
undo functionality
automatic rebase
safe replication via rsync/Dropbox/etc
And since it‚Äôs Git-compatible, adoption should be a breeze.
Jujutsu has two backends. One of them is a Git backend (the other is a native one). This lets you use Jujutsu as an alternative interface to Git. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits. You can always switch back to Git.
I‚Äôve often wondered what will come next after Git. I‚Äôm not saying this is that thing, but it‚Äôs cool to see people working on the problem.

                    <span>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this has some impacts on the code you write. If you want to keep ‚Äôem separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at your API designs in certain ways.
These are my reactions to some of the ways a value can be returned (or not).

                    <span>As developers, we use TypeScript for a few different reasons. The self-documentation aspects are huge ‚Äì being able to step into an unfamiliar function and know the shape of the objects it‚Äôs expecting is a massive boon when working on a large project. The added tooling features, with IntelliSense and its ilk, are also a big help for productivity. But to me, the most important reason to use a strongly typed system is to eliminate an entire class of runtime bugs, where a function gets passed an object it doesn‚Äôt know how to handle and fails at runtime.
It‚Äôs that last reason that leads to the purpose for this post. I recently handled a bug where a React component was throwing an exception at runtime. The source of the issue was a recent refactor done when internationalizing this area of our ap‚Ä¶</span>

This is the most significant improvement to our app‚Äôs architecture in years, and now we have unlocked the next level: multi-cloud. We talk about that at length, and how it fits in our 2022 setup. The TL;DR is that changelog.com will fly, both literally and figuratively.
We also address Steve‚Äôs comment that he left on our previous Kaizen episode - thanks Steve!
Towards the end, we talk about Gerhard‚Äôs new beginnings at Dagger, where he gets to work with a world-class team and build the next-gen CI/CD. That‚Äôs right, Gerhard is now walking the Ship It talk all day, every day. If you want to watch him code live, you can do so every Thursday, in our weekly community session.

Component Morphing
useMemo vs useEffect + setState

Relative to the Pandemic, the single biggest work question I‚Äôve been asking myself for two years is: what did we lose? What is the measurable and objective loss for teams not working in close proximity? I‚Äôve been looking for cracks. I‚Äôve been looking for leading indicators of future doom. The Great Resignation seems like a proper crack, right? But are people quitting their jobs because they can‚Äôt work together or because their current job sucks and all this terror in the air has given them a new appreciation of what really matters?
A sobering perspective.

My excitement comes from what happened with GraphQL, where the release of servers, clients, and tools adhering to a common specification has produced a rich ecosystem; and from my own development of a plugin that could support new features through the protocol.
Don‚Äôt fret if you‚Äôre new to this ‚ÄúBlock Protocol‚Äù concept, like myself: Leonardo starts off this (long) article with a nice explainer before he gets into the potential outcomes of WordPress‚Äôs involvement.

                    <span>Learn how sudo works by writing your own version in Python!
One might think that sudo is actually some binary deeply integrated into the kernel, relying on a special purpose-built system call to achieve its functionality. After all, it lets you use root without even providing the password for that account! But thanks to one bit inside file permissions, sudo can exist without any of this.

First released on August 12, 1981, MS-DOS became the foundation for business computing for almost two decades. MS-DOS stood for Microsoft Disk Operating System and was often referred to simply as ‚ÄúDOS‚Äù. It is the software that helped build Microsoft, becoming the foundation Microsoft built the Windows operating system on. It went through 8 (and a half-ish) major revisions, with the final version being shipped with Windows ME in September, 2000.

Until December 31 2022 we will pay 20,000 to 91,337 USD for exploits of vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, GKE or kCTF that are exploitable on our test lab.
We launched an expansion of kCTF VRP on November 1, 2021 in which we paid 31,337 to 50,337 USD to those that are able to compromise our kCTF cluster and obtain a flag. We increased our rewards because we recognized that in order to attract the attention of the community we needed to match our rewards to their expectations. We consider the expansion to have been a success, and because of that we would like to extend it even further to at least until the end of the year (2022).
During the last three months, we received 9 submissions and paid over 175,000 USD so far. The sub‚Ä¶</span>

Titan is an investment company, a media, and a tech company, all rolled into one. Mid last year, they closed a $58 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) at a $450 million valuation. They currently have $750 million in assets managed and more than 35,000 clients.
Why should Titan exist? In Joe‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúWall Street ignores everyday investors, and caters only to the ultra wealthy. This divide doesn‚Äôt sit well with us. So, we built Titan.‚Äù On today‚Äôs show Joe shares the journey, the why‚Äôs, the how‚Äôs, and the sequencing it might take to get to a $1 trillion of assets managed.

                    <span>This week we are talking to Robin Morero, the person behind fabled.se, a DevOps consultancy from Gothenburg, Sweden. Their motto is ‚Äúmove faster and prosper‚Äù, which Gerhard prefers to the initial ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù.
Fabled works with startups primarily, and after 26 years, Robin has a few interesting insights to share. What do you think, are haunted codebases real? At what point do pull requests become harmful? What about k3s running on KVM as a simple starting point for production? If this reminds you of #7, and the follow-up YouTube stream with Lars, it‚Äôs no coincidence.

This was years ago by the way, long before COVID, when pretty much every interview was in-person. The shock factor of pulling out 2 pages of questions wouldn‚Äôt translate so well to Zoom, haha. But still: if time runs out, you can mention that you still have a bunch of questions, and could please email them afterward.

                    <span>PgBouncer is a popular connection pooler for Postgres. PgCat is that same functionality, only in Rust. This is alpha software and there is no worse place to run alpha software (IMHO) than in places that have direct connections to your database. Still, this is worth linking to because it‚Äôs yet another instance of open source infrastructure code getting Rusty.

Last year was another record setter for our Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs). Throughout 2021, we partnered with the security researcher community to identify and fix thousands of¬† vulnerabilities ‚Äì helping keep our users and the internet safe.¬†

Thanks to these incredible researchers, Vulnerability Reward Programs across Google continued to grow, and we are excited to report that in 2021 we awarded a record breaking $8,700,000 in vulnerability rewards ‚Äì with researchers donating over $300,000 of their rewards to a charity of their choice.¬†

We also launched bughunters.google.com in 2021, a public researcher portal dedicated to keeping Google products and the internet safe and secure. This new platform brings all of our VRPs (Googl‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.
It has an S3-compatible API and can be used as a storage backend for things like NextCloud, Matrix, and Mastodon. It‚Äôs being built by a non-profit in France that is ‚Äúworking to promote self-hosting and small-scale hosting.‚Äù Why do they do this?
self-hosting means running our own hardware at home, and providing 24/7 Internet services from there. We have many reasons for doing this. One is because this is the only way we can truly control who has access to our data. Another one is that it helps us be aware of the physical substrate of which the Internet is made: making the Internet run has an environmental cost which we want to evaluate and keep under control. The physical hardware also gives us a sense of community, calling to mind all of the people that could currently be connected and making use of our services, and reminding us of the purpose for which we are doing this.

                    <span>To help fortify security defenses for their customers, dealers, suppliers, and employees, John Deere recently launched a public Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) with HackerOne.

HackerOne recently met with James Johnson, CISO at John Deere, to learn why his security team works with ethical hackers to help identify security gaps and increase their product and data security.</span>

                    <span>As humans, we constantly learn from the world around us. We experience inputs that shape our knowledge ‚Äî including the boundaries of both what we know and what we don‚Äôt know.
Many of today‚Äôs machines also learn by example. However, these machines are typically trained on datasets and information that doesn‚Äôt always include rare or out-of-the-ordinary examples that inevitably come up in real-life scenarios. What is an algorithm to do when faced with the unknown?
I recently spoke with Abhijit Guha Roy, an engineer on the Health AI team, and Ian Kivlichan, an engineer on the Jigsaw team, to hear more about using AI in real-world scenarios and better understand the importance of training it to know when it doesn‚Äôt know.
Abhijit, tell me about your recent research in the dermatology space.

                    <span>This major undertaking was discussed by Matt Ahrens on our recent ZFS episode. How it works:
The feature reflows existing data, essentially rewriting it onto a new arrangement of disks ‚Äì meaning the original group plus a newly added disk. In so doing, a new adjacent chunk of free space is created at the end of the logical RAID-Z group and thus at the end of each physical disk.
With a disclaimer:
While all capabilities of this feature have been implemented and all tests so far have been passed, there are still a few loose ends to tie up. Specifically, there is some code cleanup to do, some verbose logging to remove, some code documentation to write, and similar relatively minor tasks. We aim for this to be integrated by Q3.

                    <span>Adrien Griveau makes the case for settings as a feature, not a design bug. He build the argument from a simple (and perhaps controversial) point: ‚Äúusers love settings‚Äù
There certainly are moments where I find myself on the settings page of a product because it failed to deliver the experience I really wanted. But not all settings are created equal.
There‚Äôs a difference between product settings that a product needs to get right by default and preferences that designers deliberately shouldn‚Äôt have a strong opinion on.

                    <span>Conor O‚ÄôNeill:
I blame my life-long work obsession with automation and avoiding repetitive drudgery on my first boss and mentor Danny in S3. He was horrified to see me doing the same thing over and over in a VAX code editor and introduced me to the magical world of macros.
From that point onwards, I was a man on a mission to save us all as much time as possible in our working days.
From Yahoo! Pipes to IFTTT to Node-RED and beyond: this is quite the journey.
