                    <span>This week Adam is joined by Joe Percoco — the Co-CEO of Titan, a premier investment manager for everyone. Titan is an investment company, a media, and a tech company, all rolled into one. Mid last year, they closed a $58 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) at a $450 million valuation. They currently have $750 million in assets managed and more than 35,000 clients.
Why should Titan exist? In Joe’s words, “Wall Street ignores everyday investors, and caters only to the ultra wealthy. This divide doesn’t sit well with us. So, we built Titan.” On today’s show Joe shares the journey, the why’s, the how’s, and the sequencing it might take to get to a $1 trillion of assets managed.

                    <span>This week we are talking to Robin Morero, the person behind fabled.se, a DevOps consultancy from Gothenburg, Sweden. Their motto is “move faster and prosper”, which Gerhard prefers to the initial “move fast and break things”.
Fabled works with startups primarily, and after 26 years, Robin has a few interesting insights to share. What do you think, are haunted codebases real? At what point do pull requests become harmful? What about k3s running on KVM as a simple starting point for production? If this reminds you of #7, and the follow-up YouTube stream with Lars, it’s no coincidence.

This was years ago by the way, long before COVID, when pretty much every interview was in-person. The shock factor of pulling out 2 pages of questions wouldn’t translate so well to Zoom, haha. But still: if time runs out, you can mention that you still have a bunch of questions, and could please email them afterward.

                    <span>PgBouncer is a popular connection pooler for Postgres. PgCat is that same functionality, only in Rust. This is alpha software and there is no worse place to run alpha software (IMHO) than in places that have direct connections to your database. Still, this is worth linking to because it’s yet another instance of open source infrastructure code getting Rusty.

Last year was another record setter for our Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs). Throughout 2021, we partnered with the security researcher community to identify and fix thousands of  vulnerabilities – helping keep our users and the internet safe. 

Thanks to these incredible researchers, Vulnerability Reward Programs across Google continued to grow, and we are excited to report that in 2021 we awarded a record breaking $8,700,000 in vulnerability rewards – with researchers donating over $300,000 of their rewards to a charity of their choice. 

We also launched bughunters.google.com in 2021, a public researcher portal dedicated to keeping Google products and the internet safe and secure. This new platform brings all of our VRPs (Googl…</span>

                    <span>Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.
It has an S3-compatible API and can be used as a storage backend for things like NextCloud, Matrix, and Mastodon. It’s being built by a non-profit in France that is “working to promote self-hosting and small-scale hosting.” Why do they do this?
self-hosting means running our own hardware at home, and providing 24/7 Internet services from there. We have many reasons for doing this. One is because this is the only way we can truly control who has access to our data. Another one is that it helps us be aware of the physical substrate of which the Internet is made: making the Internet run has an environmental cost which we want to evaluate and keep under control. The physical hardware also gives us a sense of community, calling to mind all of the people that could currently be connected and making use of our services, and reminding us of the purpose for which we are doing this.

                    <span>As humans, we constantly learn from the world around us. We experience inputs that shape our knowledge — including the boundaries of both what we know and what we don’t know.
Many of today’s machines also learn by example. However, these machines are typically trained on datasets and information that doesn’t always include rare or out-of-the-ordinary examples that inevitably come up in real-life scenarios. What is an algorithm to do when faced with the unknown?
I recently spoke with Abhijit Guha Roy, an engineer on the Health AI team, and Ian Kivlichan, an engineer on the Jigsaw team, to hear more about using AI in real-world scenarios and better understand the importance of training it to know when it doesn’t know.
Abhijit, tell me about your recent research in the dermatology space.

                    <span>This major undertaking was discussed by Matt Ahrens on our recent ZFS episode. How it works:
The feature reflows existing data, essentially rewriting it onto a new arrangement of disks – meaning the original group plus a newly added disk. In so doing, a new adjacent chunk of free space is created at the end of the logical RAID-Z group and thus at the end of each physical disk.
With a disclaimer:
While all capabilities of this feature have been implemented and all tests so far have been passed, there are still a few loose ends to tie up. Specifically, there is some code cleanup to do, some verbose logging to remove, some code documentation to write, and similar relatively minor tasks. We aim for this to be integrated by Q3.

                    <span>Adrien Griveau makes the case for settings as a feature, not a design bug. He build the argument from a simple (and perhaps controversial) point: “users love settings”
There certainly are moments where I find myself on the settings page of a product because it failed to deliver the experience I really wanted. But not all settings are created equal.
There’s a difference between product settings that a product needs to get right by default and preferences that designers deliberately shouldn’t have a strong opinion on.

I blame my life-long work obsession with automation and avoiding repetitive drudgery on my first boss and mentor Danny in S3. He was horrified to see me doing the same thing over and over in a VAX code editor and introduced me to the magical world of macros.
From that point onwards, I was a man on a mission to save us all as much time as possible in our working days.
From Yahoo! Pipes to IFTTT to Node-RED and beyond: this is quite the journey.

Loops are the standard way to process collections like arrays and lists. However, some loops implement the same patterns repeatedly, leading to duplicate code. Higher-order functions—functions that use other functions as inputs or outputs—can reduce duplication by providing a simpler way to express common operations with collections.


Consider these two loops in JavaScript that decide if every object in an array meets a condition:


 
  
    
let everyRequestValid &#x3D; true;
for (const request of requests) {
  if (!isValid(request)) {
  …</span>

Relocation to a foreign country for work can be very exciting and lead to unique opportunities that couldn’t be accessed in your home country. At the same time, it’s a real challenge - I know it firsthand… Hopefully, this handbook will give you the necessary guidance. Topics covered include resume preparation, job search, salary negotiation, relocation packages, and more.

                    <span>It’s still in closed beta, but this looks like a really cool environment for data scientists and other folks who code to accomplish other goals vs code as craft. One cool thing you can do is take your Jupyter notebooks and convert them to PyFlow graphs (and vice versa).

                    <span>This week we’re joined by Nora Jones, founder and CEO at Jeli where they help teams gain insight and learnings from incidents. Back in December Nora shared here thoughts in a Changelog post titled “Incident” shouldn’t be a four-letter word - which got a lot of attention from our readers. Today we’re talking with Nora about all things incidents — the learning and growth they represent for teams, why teams should focus on learning from incidents in the first place, their Howie guide to post‑incident investigations, why the next emerging role is an Incident Analyst, and she also shares a few book recommendations which we’ve linked up in the show notes.

                    <span>Daniel Stenberg’s first step toward adding first-party JSON support to everyone’s favorite command-line URL transmitter is a flag that is basically a shortcut for the following flags:
--data [arg]
--header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;
--header &quot;Accept: application/json&quot;

Will more come of this? Time (and the community) will tell…
The discussion has been ignited in the curl community about what, if anything, we should do in curl to make it a smoother and better tool when working with JSON. The offered opinions range from nothing (“curl is content agnostic”) to full-fledged JSON generator, parser and pretty-printer (or a combination in between).

                    <span>Just wow. This is an impressively hacky hack. You’re probably wondering how? As many such things do, it all starts with a new (Chrome-only) API:
A new set of APIs affectionately known as Houdini give your browser the power to control CSS via its own Object Model in Javascript. In English, this means that you can make custom CSS styles, add custom properties, and so on…
And it ends with something that looks like this:
main {
  // ...
  --sql-query: SELECT name FROM test;
}

Our testing frameworks and processes were also evolving, so it was an exciting time to be on the team.

                    <span>An interesting exploration of Tesla’s recent update to their in-car control screen that resulted from the author not being able to find the defogger control. Here’s an example of the kind of analysis he provides:
Edward Tufte has this visual rule that 1+1&#x3D;3. With a single line on the screen, you have just that single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‘object’ on the screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.
In UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’ created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap. This cognitive load is invisible and rarely discussed but it can be a real source of confusion.

                    <span>I love how much hacking has been inspired by Wordle.
The Wordle source code contains 2,315 days of answers (all common 5-letter English words) and 10,657 other valid, less-common 5-letter English words.
We combine these to form a set of 12,972 possible words/answers.
We then simulate playing 1,000 Wordle games for each of these possible words, guessing based on the frequency of the word in the English language and the feedback received.
Then we take three measures to evaluate the observed distribution of ⬛🟨🟩 squares on Twitter according to our valid words.
The resulting code is included in the article.

                    <span>Lots of people talk about Kubernets’ complexity, but it’s rare for someone to attempt to plumb the depths of why exactly that is.
I don’t claim to have the full answer, but this post is an attempt to commit to paper two specific thoughts or paradigms I have that I reach for as I try to understand why working with Kubernetes feels so hairy sometimes.

                    <span>One of the most common questions we receive at Go Time is how to handle schema migrations in Go. In this episode Jon is joined by Mike Fridman and Vojtech Vitek, maintainers of the popular schema migration tool pressly/goose, to discuss techniques, tools, and tips for handling schema migrations.

                    <span>Vincent Ambo –the person behind nixery.dev, tvl.fyi, and a former Google engineer– shares his take on monorepos, Nix, and fully declarative systems without any Flux, Argo or Kubernetes.
While the tooling is impressive, it’s the principles behind it that captivated Gerhard’s imagination. Vincent has a rather interesting take on the monorepository idea, including one change - one version - one deploy. There are a lot of interesting links in the show notes, including all the code that Vincent uses to manage infrastructure.
As a result of this conversation, Gerhard is running Nix on one of his Macs, and also started experimenting with his first NixOS production instance.

The thought process applies equally well to proprietary code bases and open source projects.

                    <span>Old as in old school cool not old as in passe:
Despite the new gatekeepers’ best efforts, the old Internet never completely disappeared. Personal websites created by individuals that have always been the meat of the old Internet are still around. They are still about exploration, innovation, fun, and all the rest. Try as the new gatekeepers have, they simply have not had the power to eradicate the old Internet completely. All they can do is pretend it does not exist. And, that is exactly what they do.
But…
… the old Internet seems to be slowly and quietly coming back, and it is coming back even better than before. Now it has better technology and an additional well-defined purpose that it never had before.
Some people have begun to refer to personal websites as the “indie web”, the “small Internet”, or the “smol Internet”. Some seem to reserve the last two terms exclusively for the Gemini Network, which nearly quadrupled in size last year. But, I think all three terms should also apply to some of the other networks that use alternative networking protocols–the Gopher Network, the Tor network, and the ZeroNet network, to name a few.

                    <span>Linux users on Tuesday got a major dose of bad news—a 12-year-old vulnerability in a system tool called Polkit gives attackers unfettered root privileges on machines running any major distribution of the open source operating system.
Previously called PolicyKit, Polkit manages system-wide privileges in Unix-like OSes. It provides a mechanism for nonprivileged processes to safely interact with privileged processes. It also allows users to execute commands with high privileges by using a component called pkexec, followed by the command.
Oh my. It requires local access first, which is the only good news here.

                    <span>PRQL (pronounced “Prequel”) aims to be “a simpler and more powerful SQL”
Like SQL, it’s readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it transpiles to SQL.
To get an idea on PRQL’s design, they provide this SQL statement as an example:
SELECT TOP 20
    title,
    country,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
    AVG(salary + payroll_tax) AS average_gross_salary,
    SUM(salary + payroll_tax) AS sum_gross_salary,
    AVG(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
    SUM(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
WHERE salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost &gt; 0 AND country &#x3D; &#x27;USA&#x27;
GROUP BY title, country
ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
HAVING count &gt; 200

And then translate it to PRQL, which looks like:
from employees
filter country &#x3D; &quot;USA&quot;                           # Each line transforms the previous result.
let gross_salary &#x3D; salary + payroll_tax          # This _adds_ a column / variable.
let gross_cost   &#x3D; gross_salary + benefits_cost  # Variables can use other variables.
filter gross_cost &gt; 0
aggregate by:[title, country] [                  # &#x60;by&#x60; are the columns to group by.
    average salary,                              # These are the calcs to run on the groups.
    sum     salary,
    average gross_salary,
    sum     gross_salary,
    average gross_cost,
    sum     gross_cost,
    count,
]
sort sum_gross_cost                              # Uses the auto-generated column name.
filter count &gt; 200
take 20

It all started with my monthly Azure bill for December which was way over what it would normally be. It only took a moment to find the problem…
He goes on to tell the tale in excruciating detail. Be careful out there, cloud natives.

                    <span>This week Paul Copplestone, CEO of Supabase joined us to catch us up on the next big thing happening in the world of Postgres. Supabase might be best known as “the open source Firebase alternative,” a tagline they might be reluctant to maintain. But from Adam’s perspective, he’s never been more excited about what they’re bringing to market for Postgres fans. In the last year, Supabase has gone from 0 to more than 80,000 databases on their platform — and they’re still in beta…and it’s open source. Hopefully today’s show sheds some light on why everyone is talking about Supabase.

I don’t think that NixOS is the future, but I do absolutely think that the ideas in it are, so I want to write about what I think it gets right and what it gets wrong, in the hopes that other projects can take note. As such, this post will not assume knowledge of NixOS — if you’ve used NixOS significantly, there probably isn’t anything new in here for you.

                    <span>Jesse O’Brien from Test Double wants us to stop using the term “Tech Debt”
There’s loads of reasons why unmaintainable code ends up running in the systems our products are built on, but none of these fit the definition of debt.
Instead, I propose we drop the term Tech Debt and start talking about maintenance tasks. Maintenance is what we’re really talking about. When parts on our car or bicycle suffers wear from driving them around, we don’t talk to our mechanic about “mechanical debt”. (Go back and re-read that sentence, but replace things with “software” and “programmers”). We talk about maintenance.
This post starts as mostly a semantic debate, and I’m not convinced by his arguments there. I think the debt metaphor is useful when you’re talking about trading quality for speed. That’s what you do when you take on debt: you trade higher cost at a future date (principle + interest) to gain access to the money today (speed).
That being said, I really like where Jesse ends this piece talking about software maintenance and methods of going about it. Lots of actionable advice there and I’m 100% onboard with talking about software maintenance early and often. One of the first things I consider when somebody approaches me with a feature idea is ask myself: what will this cost to maintain?

                    <span>Gerhard loves simple ideas executed well, which is why he is excited to be speaking today with Ildar Iskhakov &amp; Matvey Kukuy about their startup Amixr, a.k.a. Grafana OnCall.
Ildar &amp; Matvey started with a simple idea and a simple stack - Django, Celery, RabbitMQ &amp; MySQL - all running on Kubernetes. Because they kept their main thing their main thing, and kept improving it every day for a couple of years, now your on-call can be simple too.
This is another Big Tent philosophy story with a Black Swan moment towards the end.

                    <span>Alexey Palazhchenko joins Natalie to discuss the implications of GitHub’s Copilot on code generation. Go’s design lends itself nicely to computer generated authoring: thanks to go fmt, there’s already only one Go style. This means AI-generated code will be consistent and seamless. Its focus on simplicity &amp; readability make it tailor made for this new approach to software creation. Where might this take us?

                    <span>Imagine this: you’ve been paged to investigate a production incident, and after some digging, you identify the commit with the breaking code. You decide to revert the change:
git revert 1a2b3c
Unfortunately, in doing so, a new bug is introduced! As it turns out, hidden in that old “broken” commit was some code that another part of the app depended upon, and when you reverted those lines, it left the site once again in a broken state. 🙃 Oh dear.
How can situations like this be avoided? To answer this question, we first need to examine how these types of commits come to be.
If you’ve never heard of or used git reset… this article is a must-read.

I recently discovered a simple step-by-step process that significantly increased my personal productivity and made me happier along the way.
It costs $0 and no, it’s not some note-taking or to-do list system.
The steps are:
develop meta-awareness of your state of mind.
pattern-match to identify your mind’s most common modes.
learn to pick activities that match each mode.
But that probably won’t hit home until you read through his explanation of each step.

Since our July announcement of Scorecards V2, the Scorecards project—an automated security tool to flag risky supply chain practices in open source projects—has grown steadily to over 40 unique contributors and 18 implemented security checks. Today we are proud to announce the V4 release of Scorecards, with larger scaling, a new security check, and a new Scorecards GitHub Action for easier security automation.
The Scorecards Action is released in partnership with GitHub and is available from GitHub&#x27;s Marketplace. The Action makes using Scorecards easier than ever: it runs automatically on repository changes to alert developers about risky supply-chain practices. Maintainers can view the alerts on GitHub&#x27;s code scanning dashboard, which is available for free to public repositories on GitHub.com and via GitHub Advanced Security for private repositories. 
Additionally, we have scaled our weekly Scorecards scans to over one million GitHub repositories, and have partnered with the Open Source Insights website for easy user access to the data. 
For more details about the release, including the new Dangerous-Workflow security check, visit the OpenSSF&#x27;s official blog post here.</span>

And 20 years later Adam picked up ZFS for use in his home lab and loved it. So, he reached out to Matt and invited him on the show. They cover the origins of the file system, its journey from proprietary to open source, architecture choices like copy-on-write, the ins and outs creating and managing ZFS, RAID-Z and RAID-Z expansion, and Matt even shares plans for ZFS in the cloud with ZFS object store.

This is not a MySQL vs PostgreSQL post. This is just a small summary of what I have come to appreciate about PostgreSQL as an Infrastructure Engineer.
Always good to keep in mind whenever comparing technologies: trade-offs abound and certain people in certain situations will value certain things about different technologies differently. That’s for certain. 😉

                    <span>If you’re using GitHub as your version control system of choice then GitHub Apps can be incredibly useful for many tasks including building CI/CD, managing repositories, querying statistical data and much more. In this article we will walk through the process of building such an app in Go including setting up the GitHub integration, authenticating with GitHub, listening to webhooks, querying GitHub API and more.

                    <span>From Mike Coutermarsh:
For years I’ve been noticing this pattern of infrastructure engineers I really respect preferring MySQL and product engineers preferring Postgres. It took quite a while for me to understand it. Especially coming from my background as a product engineer. Infrastructure engineers generally…
Read on to hear why (from Mike’s perspective).

                    <span>If you’ve ever built anything with web technologies, you’re probably familiar with MDN Web Docs. With about 13,000 pages documenting how to use programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the site has about 8,000 people using it at any given moment. MDN relies on contributors to help maintain its ever-expanding and up to date documentation. We reached out to 4 long-time community contributors to talk about how and why they started contributing, why they kept going, and ask what advice they have for new contributors.

                    <span>Daniel Stenberg lays out how he thinks we can view the world of software and open source in light of supply chain security, maintainer sustainability, and the like:
Inside the pyramid there is a hierarchy where things using software are build on top of others, in layers. The higher up you go, the more you stand on the shoulders of open source components below you.
At the very bottom of the pyramid are the foundational components. Operating systems and libraries. The stuff virtually everything runs or depends upon. The components you really don’t want to have serious security vulnerabilities.

                    <span>Jim Hall used grep and some fancy regular expressions to get a leg up on Wordle, the word game that keeps you guessing… but only once per day. Some people may think of Jim’s technique as cheating. I wouldn’t necessarily disagree.
But it’s a lot better than View Source-ing to get at the answer, which you can also do in a pinch. 😉
(Also there’s zero point to Wordle other than having fun, so it’s really only cheating if your answer-finding-method is less fun than you’d have otherwise. Even then, you’re only cheating yourself.)

Props to the new team on being very careful and thoughtful each step along the way, especially when it comes to funding the project. Here’s a nice note from the new team:
We’re excited to give new life to this idea and project.
This project can have a fresh start and it will become even cooler.
We felt we needed to do a public announcement because of all of the attention the project received in the media and from the community.
We believe that we have acted in the way that is best for the community.
