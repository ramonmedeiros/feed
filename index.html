You may know Simon from his extensive contributions to open source software. Simon is a co-creator of the Django Web framework (which we don‚Äôt talk about at all on this show), he‚Äôs the creator of Datasette, a multi-tool for exploring and publishing data (which we do talk about on this show)‚Ä¶most of all Simon is a very insightful thinker, which he puts on display here on this episode.

                    <span>So you got tired of AI just suggesting code edits, and now you want it to help you run code, too. Silly human, you have come to the right place. This will take five steps.
This gets an A+ for creativity. Fire up your shell, then launch Neovim. Then shell out with :VimShell to get back to where you started, but with Copilot suggestions.
My guess is the ergonomics of this are‚Ä¶ bad. But a cool hack, regardless!

                    <span>Devon Zuegel draws a comparison that I would‚Äôve never thought of:
Pirate crews developed a surprisingly similar approach to compensation in the 17th century. Just like many startups, they also balanced equity incentives with other mechanisms that would be familiar to a startup employee today, such as bonuses.
These surprising similarities offer an interesting frame through which we can reflect on why startup equity and bonuses are structured the way they are. We can learn a lot about the theory of compensation in modern companies by looking at how pirates designed incentives to organize and motivate their work.
Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop hiring ‚Äúfrontend wizards‚Äù and start looking for ‚Äúfrontend pirates‚Äù instead, matey.

Our aim is to help connect research, people and ideas across Google to shape the future of our technology innovations and their impact on society for the better. A key area of focus is AI, a field I have studied and immersed myself in over the years. I recently met with a team at the Google AI Center in Ghana that is using advanced technology to address an ancient problem: detecting locust outbreaks which threaten food security and livelihoods for millions of people. And in India and Bangladesh, our Crisis Response teams are using our machine-learning-based forecasting to provide over 360 million people with alerts about upcoming floods.

This feature was hard because there are many subtle differences in how the ID3 spec is implemented. Of course, once the PR shipped, there were other issues to solve, including an upgrade the world kind of scenario. Since Lars Wikman did all the heavy ID3 lifting, he is here with us too.

Of course you can use this model to quickly and easily create amazing, dream-like images to post on twitter, reddit, discord, etc., but this technology is also poised to be used in very pragmatic ways across industry. In this episode, Chris and Daniel take a deep dive into all things stable diffusion. They discuss the motivations for the work, the model architecture, and the differences between this model and other related releases (e.g., DALL¬∑E 2).

                    <span>A lot of ink has been spilt over the years trying to elucidate the divide between junior and senior. Mi≈Çosz Piechocki makes the distinction this way:
Junior Engineers care about writing Software. They value code quality, employ best practices, try to adopt cutting-edge technologies. They invest a lot of time into learning new technologies. To them, the ultimate goal is to create elegant, performant, maintainable software.
Senior Engineers care about building Systems. To them, creating software is just one of the steps. First of all, they question whether the software needs to be built in the first place. They ask what problems would it solve and why it‚Äôs important to solve them. They inquire who will be using the software and on what scale. They think about where the software would run and how they‚Äôre going to monitor whether it‚Äôs working properly. They also decide how to measure whether the software is actually solving the problems it was supposed to solve.
He goes on to describe how hard it is to build Systems and lists activities that are part of that process.

Memory safety bugs are the most numerous category of Chrome security issues and we‚Äôre continuing to investigate many solutions ‚Äì both in C++ and in new programming languages. The most common type of memory safety bug is the ‚Äúuse-after-free‚Äù. We recently posted about an exciting series of technologies designed to prevent these. Those technologies (collectively, *Scan, pronounced ‚Äústar scan‚Äù) are very powerful but likely require hardware support for sufficient performance. 
Today we‚Äôre going to talk about a different approach to solving the same type of bugs. 
It‚Äôs hard, if not impossible, to avoid use-after-frees in a non-trivial codebase. It‚Äôs rarely a mistake by a single programmer. Instead, one p‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Jacob Kaplan-Moss with a hot take on software quality:
Software quality is more the result of a system designed to produce quality, and not so much the result of individual performance. That is: a group of mediocre programmers working with a structure designed to produce quality will produce better software than a group of fantastic programmers working in a system designed with other goals.
What does he mean by ‚Äúa system designed for quality‚Äù? Read on to see for yourself..

                    <span>Josh Collinsworth (an unapologetic React non-fan) writes on his blog about the ubiquity of React:
I don‚Äôt know what the future of front-end looks like. Nobody really does. But it‚Äôs a very safe bet that React will continue to be the thing for a very long time.
If you‚Äôre learning front-end development in the hopes of getting a job, or trying to level up your career, and React is a knowledge gap for you, it seems like the safest bet you could make. React isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon. That said, however‚Ä¶
But why does React remain on top?
Because we don‚Äôt always value the strongest choice as much as we value consensus. (In fact, you could make an argument that consensus is the strongest choice, in many ways.)
React keeps getting picked‚Ä¶because React keeps getting picked.
But there‚Äôs a ton more to unpack. Josh got into the details on the best choice for the job, covering: Performance, learning curve, bundle size, scalability, community and support, financial backing, hireability, and developer experience.
Should I spoil it for you? Nah. Read Josh‚Äôs words for the full story.

                    <span>Here‚Äôs Natasha Lekh from Apify describing the project:
This project really is a culmination of 4 years of work trying to make the best library for web scraping in production. Web scraping is a very dynamic environment and what works today might not work tomorrow, so we at Apify had to go through a lot of trial and error to figure out the most reliable and convenient ways of crawling the web and scraping data. We hope that we finally cracked it and that now many developers will enjoy working with our new library and it will make their scrapers more reliable and time to production faster.
I like how it starts with simple HTTP-based scraping, but can switch to browser-based automation when a site has JavaScript rendering. I don‚Äôt love the built-in proxy rotation features. Not because they‚Äôre bad, per se, but because they make spammers lives easier‚Ä¶

Recently, OSS-Fuzz‚Äîour community fuzzing service that regularly checks 700 critical open source projects for bugs‚Äîdetected a serious vulnerability (CVE-2022-3008): a bug in the TinyGLTF project that could have allowed attackers to execute malicious code in projects using TinyGLTF as a dependency.   
The bug was soon patched, but the wider significance remains: OSS-Fuzz caught a trivially exploitable command injection vulnerability. This discovery shows that fuzzing, a type of testing once primarily known for detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, has considerable untapped potential to find broader classes of vulnerabilities. Though the TinyGLTF library is written in C++, this vuln‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In June 2021, we decided to start converting the source code for MDN web docs from HTML into a format that would be easier for us to work with. The goal was to get 100% of our manually-written documentation converted to Markdown, and we really had a mountain of source code to climb for this particular expedition.
In this post, we‚Äôll describe why we decided to migrate to Markdown, and the steps you can take that will help us on our mission.
The post The 100% Markdown Expedition appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

                    <span>The Preact team dropped a new state management solution on us:
Signals are a way of expressing state that ensure apps stay fast regardless of how complex they get. Signals are based on reactive principles and provide excellent developer ergonomics, with a unique implementation optimized for Virtual DOM.
Adding Signals to your Preact app only adds 1.6kB to your bundle size. So what‚Äôs the big idea?
The main idea behind signals is that instead of passing a value directly through the component tree, we pass a signal object containing the value (similar to a ref). When a signal‚Äôs value changes, the signal itself stays the same. As a result, signals can be updated without re-rendering the components they‚Äôve been passed through, since components see the signal and not its value. This lets us skip all of the expensive work of rendering components and jump immediately to the specific components in the tree that actually access the signal‚Äôs value.

                    <span>Julie Qiu, announcing Go‚Äôs new support for vulnerability management:
Go provides tooling to analyze your codebase and surface known vulnerabilities. This tooling is backed by the Go vulnerability database, which is curated by the Go security team. Go‚Äôs tooling reduces noise in your results by only surfacing vulnerabilities in functions that your code is actually calling.
There‚Äôs a new govulncheck command you can/should install and run against your project. It surfaces only the vulnerabilities that actually affect you, which is awesome.
Govulncheck is a standalone tool to allow frequent updates and rapid iteration while we gather feedback from users. In the long term, we plan to integrate the govulncheck tool into the main Go distribution.

It‚Äôs run by a nonprofit and pretty much operates as the exact opposite ‚Äî they are committed to end-to-end encryption, does not collect or store sensitive information, or backups of user data.
This post from Nitasha Tiku on The Washington Post gives a detailed backstory on Meredith Whittaker, former Google manager, and her arrival to Signal as President (and board member since 2020), as well as why Signal ‚Äúhopes to support itself with small donations from millions of users.‚Äù
The only way to escape technology that makes money off your data is by paying for products that don‚Äôt, Whittaker says. An alternative to data collection only exists if the community of people who rely on it ‚Äúkick in a little bit,‚Äù she said.
Signal is one of the few successful tech products, like the Firefox browser, led by vociferous critics of Big Tech. The app offers end-to-end encryption on group text, voice and video chat, does not collect or store sensitive information and does not store backups of your data on its servers ‚Äî a viable alternative to relentless data gathering at the center of tech industry critiques.

We believe this episode was the most popular because it‚Äôs all about building actually maintainable software and what goes into that. Kris Brandow is joined by Johnny Boursiquot, Ian Lopshire, and Sam Boyer. There‚Äôs lots of hot takes, disagreements, and unpopular opinions.
This is part two of a three part mini-series led by Kris on maintenance. Make sure you check out Go Time #195 and Go Time #202 to continue the series.

                    <span>Like many software engineers, Matt Bilyeu receives multiple emails from recruiters weekly. And, because he‚Äôs polite (and for other reasons) he tries to respond (politely) to all of them. But‚Ä¶
It would be ideal if I could automate sending these responses. Assuming I get four such emails per week and that it takes two minutes to read and respond to each one, automating this would save me about seven hours of administrative work per year.
Enter the GPT-3 API and some code that gets run by a future cron job (now that he‚Äôs tested this on a handful of emails) and Matt auto-responds to al the emails, continues to be polite, while also saving (his) time. It‚Äôs AI Matt responding the way real Matt would.

One example, we do email-based authentication (no passwords!) because I believe(d) this particular falsehood:
Emails will be received soon after they‚Äôre sent
I wish it were always true! Thankfully, there‚Äôs a lot of things on the linked list that I don‚Äôt believe. Do you?

Stable Diffusion is a new ‚Äútext-to-image diffusion model‚Äù that was released to the public by Stability.ai six days ago, on August 22nd.
It‚Äôs similar to models like Open AI‚Äôs DALL-E, but with one crucial difference: they released the whole thing.
And why it‚Äôs a really big deal:
In just a few days, there has been an explosion of innovation around it. The things people are building are absolutely astonishing.
He then details some of the innovation and it is staggering, to say the least. Open FTW!

                    <span>Why do we think StatefulSets are broken? Well, if you run through the operational needs of a stateful workload in your head, there‚Äôs one key component that you might notice is missing:
What do you do when you need to resize the underlying disk?
The dataset is a common database store that typically grows at a pretty constant positive rate. Unless you support horizontal scaling and partitioning, you‚Äôll need to add headroom in the disk as that dataset grows.
This is where Kubernetes falls flat on its face.

If you put the story in your icebox/backlog/cooler/hat, it‚Äôs time for it to go. It‚Äôs now duplicate documentation. That story was only there because you were yet to break it down into tasks. Now you have, so you delete it.

A few of you have been asking us for conversations with engineers that work for big companies, the kind that run everything from big title games to banking, and even critical national infrastructure.
In today‚Äôs episode, we talk to Ganeshkumar, a Software Engineer in the Azure Kubernetes Service team, who works on Node Lifecycle and Kubernetes Versioning, and Brendan, Kubernetes project co-founder and engineering Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Azure OSS and Cloud-native Compute. We talk about what it‚Äôs like to work for Microsoft, how mentoring works in practice, and what Kubernetes, Omega, &amp; Borg have to do with it all.

The ideas behind the DevOps movements undeniably changed the software development world for the better - but by now, the term ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù has lost all meaning.
According to Lane, some companies believe in DevOps ideas, but are unwilling to invest in changing their ways. Others aren‚Äôt convinced that some of the ‚Äúscarier‚Äù ideas are all that helpful.

                    <span>Julia Evans shares five things you can do to getting better at debugging, which is a critical skill for everyone in tech! They are:
learn the codebase
learn the system
learn your tools
learn strategies
get experience
Each thing comes with an explanation and she shares a great quote at the end (from a paper she extracted these things from):
Their findings did not show a significant difference in the strategies employed by the novices and experts. Experts simply formed more correct hypotheses and were more efficient at finding the fault. The authors suspect that this result is due to the difference in the programming experience between novices and experts.

In this article I will try to convince you that the walrus operator really is a good addition to the language and that if you use it properly, then it can help you make your code more concise and readable.

                    <span>maps.earth is a planet-scale installation of Headway, but you can easily set up your own server on a smaller scale for your own personal use by running just a few commands.
This is the first I‚Äôve heard of Headway, but I love their mission:
The Headway Project was born out of a frustration with the need to send current and future location data to a corporation in order to figure out how we‚Äôre getting from A to B. Offline-only maps apps can be frustrating to use, and sometimes suffer from performance problems, poor data coverage, or other technical limitations.
Headway aims to remedy these issues by bundling industry-standard software into a web app that‚Äôs easy to set up for yourself or your friends. No need to send your location data to anyone you don‚Äôt trust, not even maps.earth.

                    <span>In this Fully-Connected episode, Daniel and Chris discuss concerns of privacy in the face of ever-improving AI / ML technologies.  Evaluating AI‚Äôs impact on privacy from various angles, they note that ethical AI practitioners and data scientists have an enormous burden, given that much of the general population may not understand the implications of the data privacy decisions of everyday life.
This intentionally thought-provoking conversation advocates consideration and action from each listener when it comes to evaluating how their own activities either protect or violate the privacy of those whom they impact.

                    <span>Having a smaller website makes it load faster ‚Äî that‚Äôs not surprising.
What is surprising is that a 14kB page can load much faster than a 15kB page ‚Äî maybe 612ms faster ‚Äî while the difference between a 15kB and a 16kB page is trivial.
The reason for this is because of how TCP works, which is nicely explained in the post. But is 14kB even a feasible reality? The author thinks so:
That 14kB includes compression ‚Äî so it could actually be more like ~50kB of uncompressed data ‚Äî which is generous. Consider that the Apollo 11 guidance computers only had 72kB of memory.
Once you lose the autoplaying videos, the popups, the cookies, the cookie consent banners, the social network buttons, the tracking scripts, javascript and css frameworks, and all the other junk nobody likes ‚Äî you‚Äôre probably there.

Today, we are launching Google‚Äôs Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program (OSS VRP) to reward discoveries of vulnerabilities in Google‚Äôs open source projects. As the maintainer of major projects such as Golang, Angular, and Fuchsia, Google is among the largest contributors and users of open source in the world. With the addition of Google‚Äôs OSS VRP to our family of Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs), researchers can now be rewarded for finding bugs that could potentially impact the entire open source ecosystem.

Google has been committed to supporting security researchers and bug hunters for over a decade. The original VRP program, established to compensate and thank those who help make Google‚Äôs code mo‚Ä¶</span>

By now they burnt $500K and were left with only $100K. They wanted to tryout something for one last time with the $100K. One of their Co-Founders suggested that they try to productise their open source library. Peter, the Co-Founder &amp; CEO didn‚Äôt like that idea at all. This open-source library had only 580 lines of code, compared to the other 2 products which had 100x more lines of code and a very grand vision on how to define an industry.

In May of 2021, Alex shared a personal update with the world on his blog. After much reflection, he decided to step down as CEO of Clerabit to go back to his roots. In his words, ‚ÄúI love the early stages of company building. Hacking together code, setting up the Stripe account, getting the first customer. That‚Äôs my jam.‚Äù
We talk with Alex about this portion of his journey at Clearbit, the Catamaran he bought in South Africa and then sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and the new thing he‚Äôs building called Reflect that let‚Äôs you keep track of your notes, books, and meetings.

                    <span>Well, the end of Moore‚Äôs law has forced YouTube to make its own video chip. General purpose processors we‚Äôre cutting for the specialized task of video transcoding, and after a 10 minute meeting with YouTube chief Susan Wojcicki, the company‚Äôs first video chip project was approved.
The obvious motive for building your own chip for a specific purpose is cost savings, but that‚Äôs not always the case. In many instances, big tech companies are simply looking to create a strategic advantage with custom chips. Consolidation in the chip industry also plays into the equation, as there are now only a couple of custom chipmakers to choose from in a given category making general-purpose processors that aren‚Äôt great at specialized tasks.
Google said the Argos VCUs delivered a performance boost of anywhere between 20 to 33 times compared to traditional server hardware running well-tuned transcoding software.

There‚Äôs a key phrase that sets this post and its lessons apart from us here at Changelog Media ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs how we did it at Facebook.‚Äù Clearly, we are not Facebook, so we should not operate on advice that‚Äôs focused on Facebook. However, we can learn something.
Of the the five lessons shared, each can be appreciated, but one in particular stands out.
We embraced asking for forgiveness, never for permission.
This, to me, is synonymous with ‚ÄúHire people smarter than you,‚Äù because it assumes everyone can bring something to the table that former wisdom might not. It gives permission to try something new and see if something beautiful comes as a result. That‚Äôs a good thing.

While there‚Äôs still lots of work to be done before this type of human-computer interaction is possible, recent research breakthroughs in generative language models ‚Äî inspired by the natural conversations of people ‚Äî are accelerating our progress.

Around 2014, Facebook achieved a 10x performance improvement by replacing their traditional load balancers with eBPF. In 2017, every single packet that went to Facebook was processed by eBPF. Nowadays, every Android phone is using it. Truth be told, if it‚Äôs network-related and it matters, eBPF is most likely a part of it.

                    <span>Differentiating between what is real versus what is fake on the internet can be challenging.  Historically, AI deepfakes have only added to the confusion and chaos, but when labeled and intended for good, deepfakes can be extremely helpful.  But with all of the misinformation surrounding deepfakes, it can be hard to see the benefits they bring.  Lior Hakim, CTO at Hour One, joins Chris and Daniel to shed some light on the practical uses of deepfakes.  He addresses the AI technology behind deepfakes, how to make positive use of deep fakes such as breaking down communications barriers, and shares how Hour One specializes in the development of virtual humans for use in professional video communications.

The library is developed and maintained by members of the Google Security Team, but it is not an officially supported Google product.
Why the Project?
Crypto artifacts may be generated by systems with implementations unknown to us; we refer to them as ‚Äúblack boxes.‚Äù An artifact may be generated by a black-box if, for example, it was not generated by one of our own tools (such as Tink), or by a library that we can inspect and test usi‚Ä¶</span>

Open an app you want to analyze
Share the URL somewhere inside the app (e.g. send a DM to a friend, or post to your feed)
Tap on the link inside the app to open it
Read the report on the screen
His findings after using this for a bit are‚Ä¶ concerning. Especially TikTok.
