                    <span>Our latest release is for you, the people. You asked for better sounds, we designed a completely new set of sounds for 0.8.12. You asked for better longitudinal control in stop and go, so we put that in 0.8.12. You asked for a model that doesn’t take exits, 0.8.12 has that too. We really like 0.8.12, and we think you will too. Merry Christmas!</span>

                    <span>Russ Cox, for the Go team:
Generics are the most significant change to Go since the release of Go 1, and certainly the largest single language change we’ve ever made. With any large, new feature, it is common for new users to discover new bugs, and we don’t expect generics to be an exception to this rule; be sure to approach them with appropriate caution.
It didn’t make the headline, but fuzzing (tests that automatically find inputs which cause your program to crash or return invalid answers) also made it in the build, which our Go Time team has been quite excited about as well.

                    <span>The Supabase folks have open sourced a work-in-progress native PostgreSQL extension adding GraphQL support. First, they surveyed the field and liked what they saw from Graphile and Hasura, but…
we host free-tier projects on VMs with 1 GB of memory. After tallying the resources reserved for PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Kong, GoTrue, and a handful of smaller services, we were left with a total memory budget of … 0 MB 😬. Unsurprisingly, our pathological memory target disqualified any option that required launching another process in those VMs.
By their estimates, this effort will reduces the platform’s memory requirements by 525 TB/hours every month. Seems worth it!

The external security researcher community plays an integral role in making the Google Play ecosystem safe and secure. Through this partnership with the community, Google has been able to collaborate with third-party developers to fix thousands of security issues in Android applications before they are exploited and reward security researchers for their hard work and dedication.  
In order to empower the next generation of Android security researchers, Google has collaborated with industry partners including HackerOne and PayPal to host a number of Android App Hacking Workshops. These workshops are an effort designed to educate security researchers and cybersecurity students of all skill levels …</span>

                    <span>We will be working with other ECMA members and the wider JS community on the next iterations of JavaScript, in the TC39 working group. We will be pushing for features and improvements to the language that benefit everyone, but especially users of server-side JavaScript.
Specific features they plan to push forward are better support for non-JS assets in the ES module graph, better support for explicit resource management, and more extensive standard library functions for async iteration. Oh, and this:
As TypeScript is a core part of the Deno ecosystem, we are also very interested in pushing for even closer alignment of TypeScript and JavaScript in the future.

So, I often find myself with a blog post that’s ready to be submitted to Hacker News, or a tweet that’s ready to be sent, but postponing it.

                    <span>A rebuttal by Kailash Nadh to the aforelinked post.
large for-profit corporations started their widespread consumption of FOSS, ever since countless “unicorns” raised infinite amounts of funding on valuations built pretty much entirely on FOSS, ever since FOSS got co-opted into corporatisation and capitalisation. And yet, countless maintainers of critical and widely used FOSS struggle to make a living.
Whose fault is this? I do not believe that this is FOSS’ fault as a conceptual framework or a system. If FOSS was broken, the internet as we know it today wouldn’t exist; the countless marvels of technology that we take for granted and techno-economies that thrive on them wouldn’t exist; millions of software developers (like me) who learnt to write code with FOSS and learnt to make a living with that knowledge wouldn’t exist.

                    <span>The post-log4j-zero-day thinkpieces started rolling in over the weekend. I’m happy about that. We need to discuss this stuff. Here’s what Christine Dodrill’s TL;DR:
If you want me to make you useful software, pay me. If you use software made by others in their spare time and find it useful, pay them. This should not be a controversial opinion. This should not be a new thing. This should already be the state of the world and it is amazingly horrible for us to have the people that make the things that make our software work at all starve and beg for donations.
The entire article is worth considering.

                    <span>Check out the original RFC to find the genesis of this effort. Here’s the opening pitch:
We know there are huge costs and risks in introducing a new main language in the kernel. We risk dividing efforts and we increase the knowledge required to contribute to some parts of the kernel.
Most importantly, any new language introduced means any module written in that language will be way harder to replace later on if the support for the new language gets dropped.
Nevertheless, we believe that, even today, the advantages of using Rust outweighs the cost. We will explain why in the following sections.
Godspeed to everyone collaborating on what will surely be a massive, years-long undertaking.

                    <span>The meeting was supposed to be short. The incident seemed a straightforward case of human error by the new engineer.  Surely all they had to do was tell them not to do it again and move on, right?
But as the meeting went on, a series of perplexing questions began to be raised:
“How did the new engineer have access to break this in the first place?”
“What about our testing standards… How did they not catch this?”
“Actually, the change shouldn’t have impacted this service!”
“Luckily we were able to roll back quickly thanks to the instrumentation so-and-so wrote.”
“Well so-and-so left last year, do other services have the same instrumentation?”
“Wait! How are these 2 services even related?”
“I’m not sure, so-and-so wrote this doc. It seems outdated and they’re no longer with this org.”

My version updates the original package with maintained versions of packages, adds support for Rollup, esbuild and Browserify, brings support for node: protocol, and much more.

                    <span>In the quest to explore language models and develop new ones, we trained a series of transformer language models of different sizes, ranging from 44 million parameters to 280 billion parameters.
Our research investigated the strengths and weaknesses of those different-sized models, highlighting areas where increasing the scale of a model continues to boost performance – for example, in areas like reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language. We also surface results where model scale does not significantly improve results — for instance, in logical reasoning and common-sense tasks.
Sometimes size matters, sometimes it doesn’t as much. Fascinating analysis.

                    <span>Human rights defenders need information from many sources to do their work effectively. But as issues evolve and new precedents are set, finding the right information to defend a particular case can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.
For example, a human rights advocate campaigning for LGBTQ rights may want to know which countries have made the most progress and what resolutions they’ve passed. To do so, they have to manually sift through thousands of pages of dense documentation covering global laws and victims’ testimonies to find what they’re looking for.
The curation and cataloging of documents makes this process much easier, but still relies on the manual work of skilled experts. To help, the non-profit organization HURIDOCS looked to machine learning. With support from Googl…</span>

Some years ago, both Tammer &amp; Gerhard used to work in the same London office on CloudFoundry, and nowadays they are both into Kubernetes. Tammer and the SuperOrbital team are deeply experienced in this topic, and they help teams at companies like Bloomberg, Shopify, and federal U.S. agencies tackle hard Kubernetes and DevOps problems through engineering and training.
Why do companies need Kubernetes in the first place? Which are the right reasons for choosing it? Is Kubernetes a platform? Gerhard’s favourite: we are doing Kubernetes wrong, but it works better than when we were doing it right, so what’s up with th…</span>

                    <span>When you start Vim with the --clean option, it shows up in “vanilla” mode. No plugins, no configuration, just back to the roots. I have collected a ton of configuration statements over the years, some of them dating from MS-DOS or Windows 3.1. Here is the deal: I will start from scratch to find a good starting-point configuration with just the plugins available in Fedora 35. Will I survive a week of coding? I’ll find out!

                    <span>An excellent analysis of the age-old dependency management problem:
At this point, I hope the tension is pretty clear: on the one hand, it’s great to keep components small, simple, and composable. On the other hand, it’s terrible to bury yourself in a tangle of different packages, no matter how tiny they are. The Unix philosophy and killing your dependencies pull in opposite directions.
But the author doesn’t stop there. They also offer a potential solution, which shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone, requires a compromise.

Well, one of the creators of Flower, Daniel Beutel, agreed to join us on the show to discuss the project (and federated learning more broadly)! The result is a really interesting and motivating discussion of ML, privacy, distributed training, and open source AI.

                    <span>Slashbase is an open-source collaborative IDE for your databases in your browser. Connect to your database, browse data, run a bunch of SQL commands or share SQL queries with your team, right from your browser!
It’s written in Golang and Nextjs React Framework (SPA) and runs as a single Linux binary with PostgreSQL. Documentation is currently WIP.
It’s early days and security will be a major concern to get right, but this has a lot of potential to unlock some cool use cases.

                    <span>Mitchell Hashimoto is partaking in Advent of Code this year and he’s added an extra facet to the challenge: implementing each solution with a single SQL statement.
I’m not an expert at SQL (or PostgreSQL) by any means. One of the reasons I decided to use SQL was to regain some proficiency while also learning some new concepts. I expect that many of my solutions are suboptimal and there are likely much better ways (by various definitions) to reach the same answer. I’d love to hear about those (make an issue) but I won’t be merging any changes since this represents my approach.
Sounds like a fun challenge! But how does he find the time? By timeboxing each problem to just 30 minutes.

                    <span>When your productivity takes a nosedive, it adds stress and anxiety, as you don’t have enough time to accomplish your goals and do what really matters to you. Understanding why your productivity is flailing will help you get back on track.
The idea is simple: ask “why” 5 times, until you get to the root cause of your issue. It’s not dissimilar to a kid who exasperates their parents by continually repeating “why”… but the benefits can be transformative!

                    <span>This hit my radar a few times in the past year – this week, and then most recently a few months back when we had Richard Hipp on The Changelog (again) – but, I didn’t post it to the newsfeed.
Here’s what’s interesting about the SQLite test suite – it’s their secret sauce…the sustaining enablement of building a support business around SQLite. Here’s a direct quote from Richard Hipp in that episode.
Originally we thought we were gonna sell this and make money from it, and that’s how we were gonna support ongoing development. That didn’t really play out, nobody ever bought it. It does sort of become our business value, our intellectual property. I mean, you can take the SQLite code and fork it and start your own thing…but you don’t have the full test suite. You’ve got a lot of tests, but not all of them. So we’ve got a little bit of advantage over you there.

                    <span>If you’re a fan of Easter eggs in software, you won’t find them in the curl codebase. Daniel explains, “There are no Easter eggs in curl. For the good.” The parimary reason is “trust,” but also to not waste time and effort on “useless work.”
If we would allow an Easter egg to get merged, we would soon start getting improvements to the egg code and people would like to add more eggs and to change the existing one. We would spend time and effort on the silly parts and we would need to spend testing and energy on these jokes instead of the real thing. We already have enough work without adding irrelevant work to the pile.
Given the massive usage of curl, I agree with the all business approach that Daniel desires and promises.

This technology opens up new opportunities beyond what’s been possible with traditional process-based sandboxing…
Turns out using WebAssembly to isolate potentially-buggy code is a pretty big win:
Going forward, we can treat these modules as untrusted code, and — assuming we did it right — even a zero-day vulnerability in any of them should pose no threat to Firefox.

                    <span>Jacob Kaplan-Moss, who has been writing a lot about good interview questions and how to hire well:
Work sample tests are an exercise, a simulation, a small slice of real day-to-day work that we ask candidates to perform. They’re practical, hands-on, and very close or even identical to actual tasks the person would perform if hired. They’re also small, constrained, and simplified enough to be fair to include in a job selection process.
To give you a more concrete idea of what I’m talking about, here are several examples of work sample tests I’ve used…
And just in case you think he’s prescribing whiteboarding…
However, work sample tests are also a minefield: the space is littered with silly practices like whiteboarding, FizzBuzz, Leetcode, and “reverse a linked list”-style bullshit. The point of this series is to separate these silly practices from the good ones and to give you a framework and several examples to use in your hiring rounds.

                    <span>Zinc is a search engine that does full text indexing. It is a lightweight alternative to elasticsearch and runs in less than 100 MB of RAM. It uses bluge as the underlying indexing library.
It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to elasticsearch which requires a couple dozen knobs to understand and tune.
It is a drop-in replacement for elasticsearch if you are just ingesting data using APIs and searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported with zinc. Zinc provides its own UI).

                    <span>Simon Eskildsen (of napkin math) shares a word of warning about one possible decision-making trap:
Whenever you find yourself arguing for improving infrastructure by yanking up complexity, you need to be very careful.
He applies this thinking to a common technical proposal of switching from a general-purpose RDBMS to a specialty database to account for growth and scale.
I’m a proponent of mastering and abusing existing tools, rather than chasing greener pastures. The more facility you gain with first-principle reasoning and napkin math, the closer I’d wager you’ll inch towards this conclusion as well. A new system theoretically having better guarantees is not enough of an argument. Adding a new system to your stack is a huge deal and difficult to undo.

In cryptography, zero knowledge proofs let you convince me that you know something, or have done something, without revealing to me what your secret thing was.

                    <span>We’re prepping for our 4th annual state of the “log” episode where we look back at the year, discuss some of our favorite episodes as well as the most popular ones, and talk a bit about what we have in the works for 2022 and beyond.
We thought it’d be awesome to include some listener voices on the show! So, please share your favorite Changelog guests, topics, or a-ha moments you’ve had over the last year.
If you get your message included in the episode, we’ll send you a free t-shirt.
It doesn’t have to be super produced. Just pop open your Voice Memos app on your phone
Then upload your audio to ~&gt; changelog.fm/sotl
We’re recording the episode next week, so don’t sleep on the opportunity. We’d love to hear from you!

                    <span>Bryan Cantrill, announcing Hubris and Humility:
… we found ourselves increasingly forcing existing systems out of the comfort of their design centers, we wondered: was our assumption of using an existing system wrong? Should we in fact be exploring our own de novo operating system? In particular, our colleague Cliff Biffle, who had a ton of experience with both Rust and embedded systems, had a vision for what such a system might look like (namely, the system that he had always wanted for himself!). Cliff dove into a sketch of his ideas, giving the nascent system a name that felt perfectly apt: Hubris.
There’s some serious innovation going on at Oxide and I can’t wait to see what they do next.

Kubernetes Security is constantly evolving - keeping pace with enhanced functionality, usability and flexibility while also balancing the security needs of a wide and diverse set of use-cases.
Recently, the GKE Security team discovered a high severity vulnerability that allowed workloads to have access to parts of the host filesystem outside the mounted volumes boundaries. Although the vulnerability was patched back in September we thought it would be beneficial to write up a more in-depth analysis of the issue to share with the community.
We assessed the impact of the vulnerability as described in vulnerability management in open-source Kubernetes and worked closely with the GKE Storage team and the Kubernetes Security Response …</span>

                    <span>Google has spent over twenty years helping to make information accessible and useful in more than 150 languages. And our work is definitely not done, because the internet changes so quickly. About 15% of searches we see are entirely new every day. And when it comes to other types of information beyond words, in many ways, technology hasn’t even begun to scratch the surface of what’s possible. Take one example: sign language.
The task is daunting. There are as many sign languages as there are spoken languages around the world. That’s why, when we started exploring how we could better support sign language, we started small by researching and experimenting with what machine learning models could recognize. We also spoke with members of the Deaf community, as well as linguistic experts. We be…</span>

                    <span>When I was in college my professor tried teaching us regular expressions: the theory, the algebra, all that. I left dumbfounded. When I hit the Real World I quickly ran into many practical use cases where a regular expression helped me solve a problem. That’s when I finally grokked them.
If you want to improve your understanding (and deployment of) regular expressions to solve problems, but don’t have a use case at the moment… here’s a whole bunch of them for you to practice on in the meantime.

If you like a good yak shake, listening to this one is a lot more fun than doing it.
Gerhard is most excited about the Ship It Christmas gifts that we have been preparing for you. While GitHub Codespaces is not going to be part of the upcoming Christmas special episode, today’s talk covers why investing in a Codespaces integration is worth it.

                    <span>The Evil Martians have been hard at work de-stressifying their Ruby on Rails deployments with a new tool: Kuby. In this post they share their journey getting there. It’s a lot. But in the end they seem happy with the results.
Kuby lowers the bar of adopting Kubernetes for Rails apps, leveraging the power of the convention-over-configuration principle. Just as Rails conquered the world with its “build a blog in 15 minutes” idea, so too could Kuby reign supreme in the context of deployment—”deploy Rails on Kubernetes in 15 minutes”.

                    <span>Did you know Linux is approaching 30 years old? Did you know Unix is around 50 years old? I’m not knocking them — I’ve been using Linux since they were distributed on floppies. However, Unix was built for machines like the PDP-7 — you know, the kind that takes up an entire wall.
The PDP-7 - a minicomputer produced by Digital Equipment Corporation

But, have you ever wondered what an operating system built in 2022 would look like?
Today, cloud infrastructure is so complex that devops/SRE folks are attracting salaries that sometimes exceed normal software engineers.
Cybersecurity is so insanely bad that there is at least one major data breach every single week now. If you look at illicit crypto miner bots that infect k8s clusters, they literally have code that hunts down other bots and kicks…</span>

                    <span>Milosz Danczak shares a principle that was surely born from years of painful experiences:
When committing to a piece of software, favor those created by people who value backward compatibility.
But how can you tell if a piece of software is likely to remain stable? Milosz also provides some heuristics you can apply when evaluating a project.

                    <span>This question could be dismissed by saying that Nix and Docker are different tools that solve different problems. One is a toolkit for building and deploying containers and the other is a package and configuration manager. However, these tools do have some overlap: they can both be used to create reproducible environments.
While both tools aim to solve this problem, they take different approaches.
A solid rundown of the different approaches these two tools take, and how you might think about picking which one to use. Maybe you can have the best of both worlds?

It turns out that cron on macOS is frowned upon in favor of launchd, but information on how to use all the power of launchd is sparse to say the least. This resource is the best I’ve found in learning all the parts of launchd and how to use it.
Ask me anything in the comments, I’ll tell you everything I’ve learned.

Why is PHP still such a critical part of the web, when other programming languages and frameworks are seemingly more suited to the modern web? Second, what are the motivations behind the companies that have formed this new foundation?
Did you know almost half of the top 10,000 websites on the internet use PHP?! That’s quite the footprint. I’m happy to hear PHP is still alive, kickin’, and continuing to evolve. The more tools we have to build awesome websites with, the better.

                    <span>Bozhidar Batsov on the sad state of Chrome’s web rendering hegemony:
We’ve gotten to the point that Chrome-based browsers are so common that developers just stopped to bother supporting other browsers… Soon Google are going to be in complete control of web standards, unless something drastically changes. Do you want the future of browsing to lie solely in the hands of the biggest advertising business on Earth? I’m pretty sure that I don’t.

                    <span>Property-based tests give us more confidence in our code. They’re great at catching edge-cases we may not have thought of otherwise. But this confidence comes at a cost. Property tests take more effort to write. They force you to think hard about what the code is doing, and what its expected behaviour should be. It’s hard work. And on top of that, running 100+ tests is always going to take longer than running 3–5 example-based tests. This cost is real, and it raises the question:
How do we keep ourselves from over-specifying or writing unnecessary tests?

                    <span>A fascinating look at the state of packaging apps for the Linux desktop:
The stability of the Linux desktop has dramatically improved in recent years. Core library developers are finally seeing the benefits of maintaining compatibility. Despite this, many developers are not interested in depending on a stable base of libraries for binary software. Instead, they have decided to ignore and override almost all libraries pre-installed on the user’s system.
And why the author thinks Flatpak (which some believe is the future) is not the way to go.
I am not a fan. I’m going to outline here some of the technical, security and usability problems with Flatpak and others. I’ll try to avoid addressing “fixable” problems (like theming) and instead focus on fundamental problems inherent in their design. I aim to convince you that these are not the future of desktop Linux apps.

Recently, I’ve been using my own custom CSS reset. It includes all of the little tricks I’ve discovered to improve both the user experience and the CSS authoring experience.
Like other CSS resets, it’s unopinionated when it comes to design / cosmetics. You can use this reset for any project, no matter the aesthetic you’re going for.
In this tutorial, we’ll go on a tour of my custom CSS reset. We’ll dig into each rule, and you’ll learn what it does and why you might want to use it!
It has 9 rules and unlike previous resets, the goal is not to create a ‘blank slate’ that is uniform across browsers. Josh walks/talks you through each rule and why they made the cut.

Daniel provides a brief tour of the possible with the T0 family.  They finish up with a couple of new learning resources.

                    <span>What if we could contribute to a project without having to create a pull request? Imagine all we have to do is to create an issue. Yes, you can with GitHub Actions and the new GitHub Issue Forms. Let’s get to it!

                    <span>Building a modern front end in Django without reaching for a full-blown JavaScript framework. Choosing the right tools for the job, and bringing them into your project.
This is as close to a tutorial as you’ll see on Changelog News. I’m linking to it not for the step-by-step bits like talking to your “Django backend without a full-page reload”, but for the decision making bits like “when you might choose low-JavaScript.”

                    <span>Eric Bailey’s take on CSS is certainly counter to the direction most are headed:
Human-friendly CSS is an interface that prioritizes people. It allows someone using your website or web app to easily make modifications to get what they need. This is huge because we can’t know who the person is, or what circumstances they’re experiencing.
Humans reading/modifying your CSS may seem like an edge case, but it’s more common than you think:
Stylus on the Chrome Web Store has more than half a million users. Stylish has over three million. That’s a lot of people modifying the web to get what they want.
He goes on to point out that even if it weren’t that many people, it’s still worth considering for other reasons. Lots to ponder.

                    <span>The much-anticipated (and admittedly much-hyped) full stack web framework for React has opened its source (MIT license) to the public. What’s interesting about Remix? Here’s some marketing copy from the homepage:
Remix is a seamless server and browser runtime that provides snappy page loads and instant transitions by leveraging distributed systems and native browser features instead of clunky static builds. Built on the Web Fetch API (instead of Node) it can run anywhere. It already runs natively on Cloudflare Workers, and of course supports serverless and traditional Node.js environments, so you can come as you are.
Okay that is pretty sales-y (hit up the homepage for more like that), so you might prefer jumping straight over to the docs instead and check out the example Jokes app to see what’s what.

                    <span>elfshaker is a CLI tool written in the Rust programming language. It stores snapshots of directories into highly-compressed pack files and provides fast on-demand access to the stored files. It is particularly good for storing lots of similar files, for example object files from an incremental build.
They’ve had phenomenal results when using this with clang builds.

Hydrogen is their React framework for dynamic, contextual, and personalized e-commerce. And Oxygen is Shopify’s hosted V8 JavaScript worker runtime that leverages all of their platform with the hope of scaling millions of storefronts. We cover what developers can expect from the Hydrogen framework, Shopify’s big bet on React Server Components, the future of Shopify at scale with Hydrogen powered by Oxygen, and a world where merchants never have to think about the complexities of scaling infrastructure.

I did my senior thesis on using parallel computation to train neural networks. In those early days, I thought if we could 32X more compute power (using 32 processors at the time!), we could get neural networks to do impressive things. I was way off. It turns out …</span>

Nowadays they help companies all over the world build, ship and run anything from factory robots, to AI assistants in complex regulatory environments, and even medical devices that perform autonomous robotic surgery.
When Romano is not leading a team of 30 software engineers that specialise in operations, infrastructure and cloud, he is one of the organisers of DevOps Days Zürich, and also the DevOps Meetup group which is how Gerhard and Romano met in 2019.
