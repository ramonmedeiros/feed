We dig deep into their company‚Äôs mission/principles/values, hear how it it all started with a VC‚Äôs blank check that turned out to be anything but, and learn how Oxide‚Äôs integrated approach to hardware &amp; software sets them up to compete with the established players by building servers as they should be.

Why let JS have all the fun? With mix-blend-mode finally gaining wide browser-support, we now have access to many of most common shading techniques in CSS. With some choice images and a bit of careful layering it‚Äôs possible to build some surprisingly high-quality effects without the need for introducing any JS dependencies.
If you‚Äôve ever used Photoshop‚Äôs Blend Modes‚Ä¶ you can basically do that in CSS now. So cool! Check out Robb‚Äôs entire article. He includes a lot of great examples.

The way that I run my Developer Relations team focuses on three different things:
Education üßë‚Äçüè´
Community ü§ù
Product üéÅ
But first, a caveat
The way DevRel teams or organizations are structured at companies kind of depends on where it falls in that company‚Äôs priorities. So for a developer tooling company where their bread and butter is talking to developers, it‚Äôs probably gonna have an elevated position in the company. It‚Äôs incredibly important to their business and to their co‚Ä¶</span>

While most teams I talk to would love to be able to run A/B tests to accurately assess the performance impact of certain changes, the problem is pretty much every popular A/B testing tool on the market has such a negative impact on load performance that they‚Äôre essentially unusable for this purpose.
If you‚Äôre just trying to determine which of two marketing headlines converts better, then perhaps this performance difference isn‚Äôt so bad. But if you‚Äôre wanting to run an A/B test to determine whether inlining your CSS in the 
 of your pages will improve your FCP, well, those popular A/B testing tools are just not going to cut it.
He goes on to describe his process for running performant A/B tests on his static site using Cloudflare workers to swap in/out his experiments.

AI is exciting ‚Äî both from a technical perspective and when considering its underlying social benefits. And yet, to fully realize AI‚Äôs potential, it must be developed responsibly, thoughtfully and in a way that gives deep consideration to core ethical questions. After all, the promise of great reward inherently involves risk ‚Äî and we‚Äôre committed to ethically developi‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>One beautiful thing about open source software: how hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people‚Äôs Python apps got faster while they were sound asleep. From 3.11‚Äôs release notes:
CPython 3.11 is on average 25% faster than CPython 3.10 when measured with the pyperformance benchmark suite, and compiled with GCC on Ubuntu Linux. Depending on your workload, the speedup could be up to 10-60% faster.

                    <span>Bundle, transpile, install and run JavaScript &amp; TypeScript projects ‚Äî all in Bun. Bun is a new JavaScript runtime with a native bundler, transpiler, task runner and npm client built-in.
Bun is competing with Node and Deno, with the following goals:
Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).
I like those goals, and it‚Äôs designed to be a drop-in replacement for your current runtime.

You don‚Äôt need to look far on web dev social media to find somebody lecturing everybody and nobody about how you should do web development. Hell, I‚Äôve been guilty of that myself.
You should use this or that framework.
Or, you should not use this or that framework and instead use a cognitive framework like Model-View-Controller with ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô web components.
No, no, no Functional Reactive is where it‚Äôs at.
You should be writing code test-first and unit test everything.
Or, you should go light on the unit tests and focus instead on integration tests.
Or, end-to-end tests. Just test the shit out of the actual running app.
Or, you should use this different kind of unit test which doesn‚Äôt look anything like that other kind of unit test.
Those aren‚Äôt integration tests! This is an integration test! What‚Äôs wrong with you?!
Sound familiar? Unfortunately, you don‚Äôt get to be a ‚Äúfamous‚Äù social media influencer by posting reasoned, nuanced takes that end with something like: ‚ÄúI dunno, this works for me but it may not for you. It depends‚Ä¶‚Äù

                    <span>After many years of gradual improvement Vim now takes a big step with a major release. Besides many small additions the spotlight is on a new incarnation of the Vim script language: Vim9 script.
One of Neovim‚Äôs major draws is that you can avoid Vim script altogether and use Lua instead. It looks like the Vim team is addressing the two major complaints folks have with Vim script: performance and its obscure syntax:
The main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.
A secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer to commonly used programming languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript and Java.
Legacy scripts will continue to work, of course. The Vim team has no plans to drop legacy support in the foreseeable future. Learn more about Vim9 script here or with :help vim9 inside Vim itself.

The Data Cards Playbook puts Google‚Äôs AI Principles into practice by providing opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations and appeal.
Recently, Mahima‚Äôs paper on Data Cards (co-written with Googlers Andrew Zaldivar and Oddur Kjartansson) was accepted to the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (ACM FAccT). Let‚Äôs catch up with her and find out more about what brought her to Google.

                    <span>Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that teaches computer programs how to take in, interpret, and produce language from large data sets. For example, grammar checkers use NLP to come up with grammar suggestions that help people write grammatically correct phrases. But as Google‚Äôs AI Principles note, it‚Äôs sometimes necessary to have human intervention to identify risks of unfair bias.


Sunipa Dev is a research scientist at Google who focuses on Responsible AI. Some of her work focuses specifically on ways to evaluate unfair bias in NLP outcomes, reducing harms for people with queer and non-binary identities. Sunipa‚Äôs work was recently featured at a workshop at the ACM Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAcct) conference in Seoul, Korea.

                    <span>Ben Johnson, the creator of Litestream, joined Fly.io a few weeks after we migrated changelog.com - episode 50 has all the details. That was pure coincidence. What was not a coincidence, is Gerhard jumping at the opportunity to talk to Ben about Postgres vs SQLite with Litestream.
The prospect of running a cluster of our app instances spread across all regions, with local SQLite &amp; Litestream replication, is mind boggling. Let‚Äôs find out from Ben what will it take to get there.  Thanks K√ºrt for kicking off this dream.

                    <span>Miguel Grinberg built a SQLite-backed web app for the blogging team at Twilio to track their effectiveness that started to respond slugishly when it grew much bigger than he expected (6.5 million individual daily traffic records, and with a user base that grew to over 200 employees).
He thought this might be a good time to switch to Postgres, but he wasn‚Äôt sure if the wins he expected would be realized:
Having publicly professed my dislike of performance benchmarks, I resisted the urge to look up any comparisons online, and instead embarked on a series of experiments to accurately measure the performance of these two databases for the specific use cases of this application.
In this in-depth article on Twilio‚Äôs blog (no doubt being tracked by Miguel‚Äôs web app as we speak) he goes into the details of his efforts with lots of interesting findings along the way (even a plot twist!). I‚Äôll leave you with this statement from the end:
If you are going to take one thing away from this article, I hope it is that the only benchmarks that are valuable are those that run on your own platform, with your own stack, with your own data, and with your own software. And even then, you may need to add custom optimizations to get the best performance.

It‚Äôs normal for candidates not to ask harder questions about our company, so they usually miss out on a chance to (i) de-risk our company‚Äôs performance and (ii) to increase the chances they‚Äôll like working here.
Does the company have product-market fit? How much runway does the company have? Does their spending look within reason? What‚Äôs the culture like? And more tough questions that you really should be asking before accepting that offer.

                    <span>Drausin Wulsin, Director of ML at Immunai, joins Daniel &amp; Chris to talk about the role of AI in immunotherapy, and why it is proving to be the foremost approach in fighting cancer, autoimmune disease, and infectious diseases.
The large amount of high dimensional biological data that is available today, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, creates unique opportunities to push the boundaries of what is possible in biology.
To that end, Immunai has built the largest immune database called AMICA that contains tens of millions of cells. The company uses cutting-edge transfer learning techniques to transfer knowledge across different cell types, studies, and even species.

                    <span>The P in PRQL (pronounced ‚ÄúPrequel‚Äù) stands for Pipelined, which I‚Äôm convinced is a great way of writing and reasoning about queries:
A PRQL query is a linear pipeline of transformations
Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line‚Äôs result. This makes it easy to read, and simple to write.
It compiles to SQL, which means it‚Äôs compatible with most databases already and there are currently bindings for Python, JS &amp; Rust, which is the compiler itself.
Try it out in their web-based playground. (Thanks, Wasm!)

Markwhen is like Markdown for timelines
Tauri 1.0 Release
Why products should be ‚Äúslick‚Äù, not just viable
I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead.
No-one knows what they are doing

                    <span>Brandon Rhodes‚Äôs solution to conflicts between his ~/bin scripts and system binaries: the humble comma
I heartily recommend this technique to anyone with their own ~/bin/ directory who wants their command names kept clean, tidy, and completely orthogonal to any commands that the future might bring to your system. The approach has worked for me for something like a decade, so you should find it immensely robust. And, finally, it‚Äôs just plain fun.

                    <span>Speaking this morning at The Linux Foundation‚Äôs Open-Source Summit, Linus Torvalds talked up the possibilities of Rust within the Linux kernel and that it could be landing quite soon ‚Äì possibly even for the next kernel cycle‚Ä¶
The Linux 5.20 merge window will open following the release of Linux 5.19 stable around the end of July, so at that point we‚Äôll see if the Rust PR is submitted and lands for this next kernel version. It wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising with how things have been pacing and already having the blessing of Linus.
Lots of positivity about this in the attached comment thread.

Or a picture of two robots having a romantic evening at the movies? These might sound far-fetched, but a novel type of machine learning technology called text-to-image generation makes them possible. These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.
Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models ‚Äî Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches.

                    <span>Building products is a difficult and time-consuming effort. Figuring out what the problems, finding a potential solution to that problem, and then building that solution all take a decent chunk of time and effort. It‚Äôs due to this process that the minimum viable product was born. The motivation for building an MVP is still valid. Build something small and easy to test, launch quickly, and pivot or trash it if it doesn‚Äôt perform as desired.
There is another, less selfish way.
I read an article by Jason Cohen a few years ago which changed the way I think about product development. Instead of building MVPs, we should be building SLCs. Something Simple, Loveable, and Complete.

                    <span>Simon Willison figured out how to run a SQL query directly against a CSV file using the sqlite3 CLI:
sqlite3 :memory: -cmd &#x27;.mode csv&#x27; -cmd &#x27;.import taxi.csv taxi&#x27; \
  &#x27;SELECT passenger_count, COUNT(*), AVG(total_amount) FROM taxi GROUP BY passenger_count&#x27;

Ie TL;DR‚Äôd the one-liner for ya, but you‚Äôll have to go to Simon‚Äôs site for the explainer.

                    <span>While still in its infancy, MLOps has attracted machine learning engineers and software engineers in general. With every new paradigm comes new challenges and opportunities to learn. In this primer, we highlight a few available resources to upskill and inform yourself on the latest in the world of MLOps.
Good resources, regardless of whether you think MLOps is its own thing or should be rolled into DevOps.

                    <span>AppleInsider explains Apple‚Äôs new Private Access Tokens (PAT) tech announced at WWDC:
Using a new HTTP authentication method called PrivateToken, a server uses cryptography to verify a client passed an iCloud attestation check.
When the client needs a token it contacts an attester ‚Äî in this case, Apple ‚Äî which performs the process using certificates stored in the device‚Äôs Secure Enclave.
I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to kill CAPTCHAs for us, but this will be an Apple-only solution for now:
The company is working to help make Private Access Tokens a web standard, but there is no mention of tokens working on Android or Windows. People on those platforms may have to put up with CAPTCHAs, for now ‚Äî or wait for Microsoft‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs work on the matter.
I believe this is the draft of the standard that they‚Äôre referring to. Cloudflare also has a nice article on their work in this space.

I‚Äôm going to let you in on a little secret. Most of us who are running businesses had no real idea what they were doing when they started, and still struggle with decisions now.
I tell people this all the time when they ask me for advice. I‚Äôll still give them my advice. But it comes with the disclaimer that I really have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. üòÜ

                    <span>Tauri is an app framework built with Rust. You build UIs for it using virtually any frontend JavaScript framework. It has three major tenets: security, privacy, and environment. Speaking to the latter:
The apps you make are lean and performant, which reduces electricity, storage space, and general natural resource consumption. Every byte saved is a leaf on a tree that gets to grow.
This project has gotten a lot of early interest because, well, people have been waiting for an Electron alternative to emerge. Now that Tauri is 1.0 I‚Äôm guessing adoption will really start to take off.
Even more good news: we have an episode on Tauri in the hopper for ya üí™

                    <span>Many organizations such as Commoncrawl, WebRecorder, Archive.org and libraries around the world, use the warc format to archive and store web data.
The full datasets of these services range in the few pebibytes(PiB), making them impractical to query using non-distributed systems.
This project aims to make subsets such data easier to access and query using SQL.
Crawl a site with wget and import it into WarcDB:
wget --warc-file changelog &quot;https://changelog.com&quot;

warcdb import archive.warcdb changelog.warc.gz

Then you can query away using SQL, such as this one to get all response headers:
sqlite3 archive.warcdb &lt;&lt;SQL
select  json_extract(h.value, &#x27;$.header&#x27;) as header, 
        json_extract(h.value, &#x27;$.value&#x27;) as value

This time, we talk about a database built for observability: FrostDB, formerly known as ArcticDB. eBPF generates a lot of high cardinality data, which requires a new approach to writing, persisting &amp; then reading back this state.
TL;DR FrostDB is sub zero cool &amp; well worthy of its name.

In trying to get a particularly tricky habit to stick, I tried dozens of apps and nothing worked for me. Recording an action felt like yet another chore. None could approach the most basic satisfaction of simply crossing out an item on a list.
Could you design a simple action that felt as satisfying and infuse it with as much symbolism? Were we about to redesign the checkbox?
I think you know where this is headed.

Application frameworks most often define SSR as the alternative to SSG (static site generation). A runtime server is used to render the components on request.
Component frameworks define SSR as generating static HTML from a component definition. They offer no preference as to whether this should or can happen at build time or at request-time.

You can run the tool from a CLI, assuming your code is hosted on GitHub (more SCM hosts coming soon):

I couldn‚Äôt find a comprehensive list of what checks are in the benchmark, but it appears they are referring to this guide. You can see what an example run‚Äôs results like like in the README.

KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 in 7by7 format 

There are no words that would do justice to the amount of talented, hard-working &amp; humble people that came together in the welcoming Valencia, Spain. The pictures above still fall short. There are 4k+ other pictures here that do a better job. This is my attempt to capture a fraction of the delight that was KubeCon CloudNativeCon EU 2022.
I will start by focusing on the people that went above and beyond. You are the reason why the Cloud Native community thrives and goes from strength to strength. All your hard work and passion make this conference the best one in the world ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Sid and the GitLab team continue to enjoy their Rails-based ‚Äúmodular monolith‚Äù
A modular monolith is the exact opposite of a distributed ball of mud: a well-structured, well-architected, highly modular program that runs as a single process and is as boring as possible.
Sid doesn‚Äôt pull any punches. No regrets!
Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have a proper plugin interface? Or better yet, a services interface modeled on microservices? In a word: no. Not only do these approaches impose deployment and integration hurdles that go far beyond ‚ÄúI made a small change to the source code,‚Äù they often enforce architectural constraints too rigidly. Anticipating all the future extension points is a fool‚Äôs errand, one that we luckily did not embark on and do not have to.

The past year has seen an industry-wide effort to embrace Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)‚Äîa list of all the components, libraries, and modules that are required to build a piece of software. In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what‚Äôs in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it‚Äôs impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components‚Äîincluding those produced by others. This increased interest in SBOMs saw another boost after the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its Secure Software Development Framework, which requires SBOM information t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>For the last year, we&#x27;ve been working on the development of rust-minidump, a pure-Rust replacement for the minidump-processing half of google-breakpad. The first in this two-part series explains what minidumps are, and how we made rust-minidump.
The post Everything Is Broken: Shipping rust-minidump at Mozilla ‚Äì Part 1 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

                    <span>An ever-expanding attack surface is a global concern for most organizations and complicates an M&amp;A, especially for CISOs. The M&amp;A prospect may have a partially unprotected attack surface, thus increasing security risk coming in the form of a gap between the attack surface they can and do protect and the attack surface (and accompanying assets) they need to defend. This gap is what many M&amp;A prospects bring to the table. And while an M&amp;A may have undisputed business and strategic value, CISOs must still address the security risks involved in acquiring another organization&#x27;s assets and its current attack surface, fully protected or not.</span>

                    <span>Fresh is in the ‚ÄúSSR with client-side progressive enhancement‚Äù camp. I have to admit their list of ‚Äòstand out‚Äô features are quite appealing:
No JS is shipped to the client by default
No build step
No configuration required
TypeScript support out of the box
If you‚Äôre feeling some JavaScript and/or Framework Fatigue, this won‚Äôt help. But competition pushes everyone (Next, Remix, etc) to improve. So, whether you check Fresh out or not, hopefully it‚Äôll have a positive impact on your work.
