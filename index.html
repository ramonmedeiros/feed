                <p>On this special edition of The Changelog, we’re talking with Cory Wilkerson, Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub, about GitHub Codespaces. For years now, the possibility of coding in the cloud seemed so close, yet so far away for a number of reasons. According to Cory, the raw ingredients to make coding in the cloud a reality have been there for years. The challenge has really been how the industry thinks, and we are now at a place where the skepticism in cloud based workflows is “non-existent.”

Harbormaster is for you.
You create a YAML config file with all the git repos you want it to include and it’ll watch them for changes (on a timer) and do the necessary cloning/pulling, service restarting, etc. that needs doing to make it all run. Simple. Neat!

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>From Niels Leenheer:
It is not difficult to find some incredibly shitty takes on Electron, and every time it boils down to: It’s slow. Downloads are huge, and it uses a lot of memory. Electron apps are just websites. Developers that are using Electron are taking the lazy or easy approach to cross-platform development. Native apps are just better in every single way.
And somehow, these arguments often come from Apple fans when they discover one of their apps isn’t “native” or when a macOS favourite is consid…</p>

Today we are releasing Deploy Beta 2. This is the second in a series of beta releases that will be made over the coming months. Each release will add features and refine the programming model. The releases will culminate in a General Availability announcement that we estimate will happen in Q4 2021.

                <p>Routing might be implemented in a number of ways: it’s sometimes code running on a server that maps a path to files on disk, or logic in a single-page app that waits for changes to the current location and creates a corresponding piece of DOM to display.
Buggy routing (and breaking your browser’s Back button) has been the achilles heel of SPAs since forver. Hopefully better tooling like this URLPattern proposal will help developers better handle the need.

We started our GraphQL adoption journey by building our checkout experience. We saw tremendous benefits in adopting GraphQL when our checkout app built with GraphQL became our guiding light.We built more apps, provided infrastructure support, launched a public GraphQL API, and provided trainings and learning materials across the company. We also set up a standards body, provided a GraphQL tools fanny pack, and built sample apps to help teams get started.

                <p>After months of talking about and planning this episode, we decided near the very end to invite Paul from Heavy Spoilers to join us for a deep, spoiler filled, discussion on the movie Tenet, which was directed by Christopher Nolan and released September 2020. If you’re a fan of Tenet, you’ll love this episode.
Warning: This episode literally includes heavy spoilers. So come back after you’ve watched the film, or proceed if that doesn’t bother you.

                <p>From Axios:
Apple said Thursday it will relax some App Store rules in order to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by U.S.-based developers over its store terms.
…Apple will let developers communicate with users about alternative payment methods outside of the App Store. It will also set up a $100 million fund for small developers and make some other changes to its practices, but it’s keeping its overall commission structure.
This settlement is not yet approved by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.

We are truly living in an era of user-hostile software, and when I say “user-hostile” I mean it as “software that doesn’t really care about the needs of the user but rather about the needs of the developer.” And this is not a problem that is bound to a specific operating system (or version thereof) or class or computers. It’s literally cross-platform, and it follows customers from home, to office, to their commute.

…think of this as an argparse equivalent for Bash. You provide a YAML file listing commands, subcommands, arguments, and flags, and it automatically generates a Bash script that can parse and validate them, provide help messages, and run your code for each command.
It also lets you keep the actual code for each command and subcommand in separate files, which are merged together into one distributable Bash script at generation time. It’s basically a tem…</p>

I don’t think I noticed I was burnt out until early February 2021, almost six months later. Honestly, realizing it was kind of a relief. I hadn’t noticed how bad it had gotten. A few weeks later, I quit my job. And then a new, different kind of struggle started. Not knowing what to do with myself, or how to recover.

With the help of many great tools, we’ve successfully built a fast, collaborative todo app. More importantly, we’ve worked out a reasonably simple approach to building similar web apps. As the user base and feature set grow, this approach shall scale well in both performance and complexity.

                <p>There was a glorious (albeit too short) period on the web when we were mashing up APIs from various startups and tech companies to create cool stuff. Then things changed. The web grew up, became Serious Business™️, and free/public APIs got harder and harder to find. Turns out, there’s still a bunch of good ones out there!
This repo has collected them in one long, categorized list for us to reference. 👏

MDN is 16 years old (and yes it can drink in some countries), all that time ago it was a great place for all of Mozilla to document all of their things. As MDN evolved and the web reference became our core content, other areas became less relevant to the overall site. We have ~11k active pages on MDN, so keeping them up to date is a big task and we feel our focus should be there.
