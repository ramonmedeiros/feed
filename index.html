                    <span>Rachel by the Bay:
There’s a post going around tonight about how someone forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full table scans (or something like that). The rub is that instead of just being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy vendor system charged by the row or somesuch. So, by scanning the whole table, they touched all of those rows, and oh hey, massive amounts of money just set ablaze!
The usual venues are discussing it, and I get the impression some people have the wrong approach to this. I want to describe a truly bad database schema I encountered, and then tell you a little about what it did to the system performance.
A fun story with an excellent twist at the end.

One of mine around coding goes back to college in the 70s. I learned about parsing arithmetic expressions and putting them into Reverse Polish notation. And then, I figured out that, just like multiplication is repeated addition, division is repeated subtraction.

We cover Swyx’s recent writing on the light and dark side of the API economy — something he calls “living above or below the API,” his thoughts on Cloudflare eating the cloud by playing Go instead of Chess, and we also talk about the work he’s doing at Temporal and how’s taking his frontend skills to the backend.

All these commands work on Linux, macOS, WSL, and anywhere you have a UNIX environment.

                    <span>Brian Di Croce writes a few thousand words saying SLOW DOWN in different ways. And it’s good!
Don’t race yourself to a burnout or a weaker desire to work in this creative field. Slow down. Know what you’re doing before you start typing the first line of code. Make sure that you understand what needs to be built. If what needs to be built isn’t 100% sure by anyone, then accept the reality that it might have to be built incrementally. It’s not the ideal, but sometimes it’s real.
If you’ll allow me to pick one nit with this post: successful software is rarely finished. And if you’re making successful software you likely won’t finish either. So, I would suggest wording this slightly different: Slow down to go faster 😉

                    <span>This is a short post by long-time open source maintainer Chris Manson about commitment to tasks in the open source world and how life always takes priority over dev.
We always need to keep in mind that most open source contributions are given from people that are opting to give up their spare time (usually for free) and the level of expectation can never come anywhere close to the sort of relationship that an employer might have with an employee or contractor.

This morning, I shared the following post with Hubbers in response to Nat’s announcement about his next adventure. I am thrilled to take on the role of CEO to build the next phase of GitHub for our global community of software developers.
Exiting as CEO, Nat Friedman shared his thanks in a post titled “Thank you, GitHub”.
This morning, I sent the following post to the GitHub team. TL;DR: I’m moving on to my next adventure, and Thomas Dohmke (currently Chief Product Officer) will be GitHub’s next CEO. I will become Chairman Emeritus, which fulfills my lifelong ambition of having a title in Latin. My heartfelt thanks to every Hubber and every developer who makes GitHub what it is, every day.

                    <span>Two up-and-coming database options compared:
Recently, TimescaleDB published a blog comparing ClickHouse &amp; TimescaleDB using timescale/tsbs, a timeseries benchmarking framework. I have some experience with PostgreSQL and ClickHouse but never got the chance to play with TimescaleDB. Some of the claims about TimescaleDB made in their post are very bold, that made me even more curious. I thought it’d be a great opportunity to try it out and see if those claims are really true.

                    <span>The team’s goal is to become “the de-facto open-source alternative to MongoDB.” Here’s why:
MongoDB is a life-changing technology for many developers, empowering them to build applications faster than using relational databases. Its easy-to-use and well-documented drivers make MongoDB one of the easiest to use database solutions available. However, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots, changing the license to SSPL - making it unusable for many open source and commercial projects.
Most MongoDB users are not in need of many of the advanced features offered by MongoDB; however, they are in need of an open-source database solution. Recognizing this, MangoDB is here to fill the gap by providing an alternative.
This is currently a proof of concept. The concept: a proxy that converts Mongo’s wire protocol to SQL and stores everything in PostgreSQL. Fascinating idea! Will it work?

                    <span>The linked post is about a new book by Jeremy Wagner, but I just wanted to highlight the excellent aside on book writing by Chris Coyier near the end:
Write a blog post first, or maybe a whole bunch of blog posts. That’ll prove you clearly have words to say about this. Plus it will get the energy of your idea into the world. You might get feedback and constructive insights on the idea as it is shared. Then, hopefully, you can turn that blog post into a talk. That’ll really get you thinking deeply about your idea while getting even more comfortable with the idea of sharing it clearly. And, if all goes well, turn all of that into a book!
Looks like Jeremy did just that.

                    <span>Vladimir Dementyev shares a deep dive into some necessary profiling he did on one of the Go services and how he finally figured out what was going wrong:
Here’s a question: how can we see what’s happening inside an arbitrary Go process? Or, more precisely, how can we see what all the goroutines are doing at any given moment? If we could crack that, it could help us figure out why they’re not processing our requests.

                    <span>We recently upgraded our monolith application from Rails 6.0 to Rails 6.1. By evaluating our prior experience on Rails upgrades, we have streamlined the process and we want to share it with you.
In this post we give some insights on our workflow, from organizing such a milestone to actually delivering it without blocking an engineering team of more than 160 developers, building an application that peaks at more than 100k requests per minute.

Tracking program metrics can help organizations identify issues, spot opportunities, and take corrective actions. To do this, stakeholders must know which metrics to track and how to interpret the results.</span>

So in this new experimental format of release documentation, we hope to give a better picture of what will change with this release of openpilot.</span>

                    <span>Have you heard? The just-released 12th version of Next.js uses a Rust-based compiler (swc) to achieve ~3x faster local refreshes and ~5x faster production builds.
Compilation using Rust is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default using Next.js 12, replacing transforming JavaScript and TypeScript files. This meant we had to port the Babel transformations in Next.js to Rust, including a brand new CSS parser in Rust used to implement the styled-jsx transform.
With the increased popularity of Rust and Go-based JS tooling, could there be a future where we don’t use any JavaScript to build our JavaScript apps? 🤔

                    <span>This post by Pat Shaugnessy echoes Matt Rickard’s sentiment that we discussed in-depth on The Changelog 463:
The best way to learn a new programming language, just like a human language, is from example. To learn how to write code you first need to read someone else’s code. But who is the best person to learn from? Which code should we read? Where should we look to find it?
Pat was looking into Crystal and found its standard library to be excellent reading. I think his conclusion generalizes pretty well, with caveats.
Older languages often have areas of the standard library that were written prior to new language features, so they are no longer idiomatic.
Some standard library code is necessarily low-level, even dipping into the underlying language or using esoteric features. This can make for some tough sledding.
Standard library code is used so frequently that it’s often highly optimized for performance, which reduces readability.

Starting today and for the next 3 months (until January 31 2022), we will pay 31,337 USD to security researchers that exploit privilege escalation in our lab environment with a patched vulnerability, and 50,337 USD to those that use a previously unpatched vulnerability, or a new exploit technique.
We are constantly investing in the security of the Linux Kernel because much of the internet, and Google—from the devices in our pockets, to the services running on Kubernetes in the cloud—depend on the security of it. We research its vulnerabilities and attacks, as well as study and develop its defenses.
But we know that there is more work to do. That’s why we have decided to build on top of our kCTF VRP from last year and triple our previous rew…</span>

                    <span>This essay from Mary Rose Cook explains how Git works. Who should read this? Anyone who wants a deeper understanding of Git.
The essay assumes you understand Git well enough to use it to version control your projects. It focuses on the graph structure that underpins Git and the way the properties of this graph dictate Git’s behavior. Looking at fundamentals, you build your mental model on the truth rather than on hypotheses constructed from evidence gathered while experimenting with the API. This truer model gives you a better understanding of what Git has done, what it is doing, and what it will do.

We’ve still got a long way to go with disassembly, but this new MacBook Pro has, at the very least, the first reasonably DIY-friendly battery replacement procedure since 2012.

                    <span>Brandon Quakkelaar:
I am not a big social media guy anymore. Over the last few years I’ve been actively avoiding it. I’m not a fan of each platform’s privacy concerns, and users need to be very cautious to avoid flamewars and infinite doomscrolling. If we aren’t careful, social media’s default state seems to devolve into just destroying trust and goodwill. I prefer society in real life.
However, avoiding social media means that we lose a lot of interesting articles, funny memes, and informative videos that are shared on those platforms.
In case you haven’t guessed it, he goes on to prescribe RSS as the solution to this problem. I have a half-written blog post titled, “RSS is the indie social network we’ve been looking for”… so I tend to agree with him.

                    <span>When I reflect on the past two decades of computer science research, few things inspire me more than the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the field of artificial intelligence.


In 2001, some colleagues sitting just a few feet away from me at Google realized they could use an obscure technique called machine learning to help correct misspelled Search queries. (I remember I was amazed to see it work on everything from “ayambic pitnamiter” to “unnblevaiabel”). Today, AI augments many of the things that we do, whether that’s helping you capture a nice selfie, or providing more useful search results, or warning hundreds of millions of people when and where flooding will occur. Twenty years of advances in research have helped elevate AI from a promising idea to an indispensable aid in billions…</span>

                    <span>Today Adam is joined by Evan Kaplan, CEO of InfluxData. Evan’s journey to become the CEO was not by way of founder, in this company. Evan has founded several companies in the past, and he’s been in a CEO position for more than 22 years. But InfluxData was founded by Paul Dix, and Paul knew years ago that his role (best role?) was to lead the technical and product direction of the company, which lead him to Evan. Today we share that story as well as a glimpse into operating the business that built the defacto platform for building time series applications with deep roots in open source.

It has become quite absurd to argue that remoteness has to mean becoming a less visible and valued contributor to your organization. I hope this post can help you convince anyone who might still believe that communicating remotely still has to be a pain.

At Google, keeping you safe online is our top priority, so we continuously build the most advanced privacy-preserving technologies into our products. Over the past few years, we&#x27;ve utilized innovations in cryptographic research to keep your personal information private by design and secure by default. As part of this, we launched Password Checkup, which protects account credentials by notifying you if an entered username and password are known to have been compromised in a prior data breach. Using cryptographic techniques, Password Checkup can do this without revealing your credentials to anyone, including Google. Today, Password Checkup protects users across many platforms including Android, Chrome and Google Password Manager.…</span>

                    <span>The New Stack’s Jennifer Riggins covering Kubecon+CloudNativeCon 2021:
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has more than 138,000 contributors making over 7 million contributions to more than 100 open source projects. It’s reasonable that getting started in open source would feel overwhelming — to say the least. So how do you get started as a contributor to cloud native projects? How do you find a mentor or guide to help you along?
She draws many solid takeaways from a panel that discussed this exact topic at the event. This quote from Grafana’s Uchechukwu Obasi is spectacular:
“I think open source really changed my life,” Obasi said. “I’m African, I live in Africa, but having the opportunity to work on software that impacts millions of lives, it’s an opportunity that I never take for granted. If open source can change my life, it can change yours too.”

                    <span>This is Gerhard’s first set of interviews from KubeCon North America 2021.
William Morgan shares with us some of the finer Linkerd details, such as the underlying security theme, why native Kubernetes objects are preferable to more CRDs, and the joy of meeting team members in person.
Frederic Branczyk speaks about Parca, a new continuous system profiling tool that uses eBPF to help you understand what is happening on your hosts.
Andrew Rynhard gives us a great Talos OS and Kubespan perspective, and shares some really good follow-up videos on these topics.
The last conversation is with David Flanagan - you know him as Rawkode - about new beginnings. It’s only been less than two months since we’ve had him in episode 18, and he kept really busy. Caleb, his 3 weeks old baby boy, was the younge…</span>

With Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, we’re launching our most secure Pixel phone yet, with 5 years of security updates and the most layers of hardware security. These new Pixel smartphones take a layered security approach, with innovations spanning across the Google Tensor system on a chip (SoC) hardware to new Pixel-first features in the Android operating system, making it the first Pixel phone with Google security from the silicon all the way to the data center. Multiple dedicated security teams have also worked to ensure that Pixel’s security is provable through transparency and external validation.

                    <span>Posted by Royal Hansen, Vice President, Security 


According to an Opus and Ponemon Institute study, 59% of companies have experienced a data breach caused by one of their vendors or third parties. Outsourcing operations to third-party vendors has become a popular business strategy as it allows organizations to save money and increase operational efficiency. While these are positives for business operations, they do create significant security risks. These vendors have access to critical systems and customer data and so their security posture becomes equally as important.
Up until today, organizations of all sizes have had to design and implement their own security baselines for vendors that align with their risk posture. Unfortunately, this creates an impossible situation for vendors and…</span>

Replit has a history of betting on nascent technologies. The first version of Replit used WebAssembly long before WebAssembly found widespread adoption. We’re betting that the Nix project will improve performance across the board, sidestep a whole slew of bugs for our community, and let any Replit user build and publish programming environments.

Another point that drew my attention (as a creator of javascript-algorithms repo) was the fact that Dynamic Programming (DP) approach might be smoothly applied to solve it. And, if you’re like me and still on your “learning algorithms” journey, this algorithmic solution may enrich your personal DP arsenal.

                    <span>Curl maintainer Daniel Stenberg:
We can’t know for sure which products are on the top list of the most widely deployed software components. There’s no method for us to count or estimate these numbers with a decent degree of certainty. We can only guess and make rough estimates – and it also depends on exactly what we count. And quite probably also depending on who‘s doing the counting.
He goes through his process of trying to determine contenders, and ends up with zlib, qlite, and libcurl. Other have added OpenSSL, expat and the Linux kernel to that list.

                    <span>Jamie Brandon on improving how fast he can work.
There are ~33k characters in the rematch repo, most of which are tests. I type ~500 characters per minute. So if I could sit down and type the correct code first time, without making mistakes or getting distracted, it would take 66 minutes. I don’t see any fundamental reason why I shouldn’t be able to at least approach that bound for such simple code - maybe get within 3 hours, say. So there is potentially room for another 10x speedup.
So let’s suppose a 10x speedup is within reach…

                    <span>It surprises me that when people think of “software that brings about the singularity” they think of text models, or of RL agents. But they sneer at decision tree boosting and the like as boring algorithms for boring problems.
To me, this seems counter-intuitive, and the fact that most people researching ML are interested in subjects like vision and language is flabbergasting. For one, because getting anywhere productive in these fields is really hard, for another, because their usefulness seems relatively minimal.

                    <span>The business context for a rent versus buy dichotomy was first introduced to me by Adam a few years back. It has since then proven very useful as a tool for thinking about the relationship people have to their jobs/companies.
In this post, Cate Huston does an excellent job laying it all out, including which things are generally rented, and which things are generally bought.
Thinking about career decisions this way, you can consider different tradeoffs and options that work best for you at any given time… My question is: are you making those choices mindfully? And do they work for the life and career you want?

                    <span>Hummingbot integrates cryptocurrency trading on both centralized exchanges and decentralized protocols. It allows users to run a client that executes customized, automated trading strategies for cryptocurrencies.
We created Hummingbot to promote decentralized market-making: enabling members of the community to contribute to the liquidity and trading efficiency in cryptocurrency markets.
There are many arbitrage opportunities between centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance (which often have high liquidity) and decentralized exchanges like Loopring and Terra (which thus far rarely have high liquidity).
If you have the financial stomach for it, Hummingbot could help you take advantage of these opportunities while providing liquidity to the decentralized markets.

                    <span>Martin Tournoij lays out a bunch of ways he finds zsh more compelling than bash.
There are many more things. I’m not going to list them all here. None of this is new; much (if not all?) of this has around for 20 years, if not longer. I don’t know why bash is the de-facto default, or why people spend time on complex solutions to work around bash problems when zsh solves them. I guess because Linux used a lot of GNU stuff and bash was came with it, and GNU stuff was (and is) using bash. Not a very good reason, certainly not one 30 years later.

                    <span>This week Gerhard is talking with Arnaud Porterie, founder of EchoesHQ, a new utility that measures and communicates engineering activity.
They start by re-creating the 60 seconds Y Combinator pitch, and then shift focus to what it was like to get EchoesHQ off the ground. Next, they tackle something which is always on Gerhard’s mind: Why is it important to connect our daily engineering activity to intent?
Before EchoesHQ, Arnaud used to run the core team and the open source project at Docker, and combined with other engineering leadership roles that he held for over a decade, he kept encountering misalignment that was preventing organisations from making meaningful progress. Let’s hear why EchoesHQ might just be a great way of addressing this.

An analysis of current and potential kernel security mitigations
  
Posted by Jann Horn, Project Zero
  
Introduction
This blog post describes a straightforward Linux kernel locking bug and how I exploited it against Debian Buster&#x27;s 4.19.0-13-amd64 kernel. Based on that, it explores options for security mitigations that could prevent or hinder exploitation of issues similar to this one.
I hope that stepping through such an exploit and sharing this compiled knowledge with the wider security community can help with reasoning about the relative utility of various mitigation approaches.

                    <span>This week we sat down for an interview with Qubit the dog, whose human Julian Kelly is one of our lead Research Scientists with Google Quantum AI. Qubit was born in 2012, right when Julian and team were first designing the qubits that now underlie Google’s quantum computers. He nearly received the honor of pressing the submit button for the team’s beyond-classical result published in Nature, but he was narrowly edged out by a human.


Qubit has never been interviewed before on such a range of technical and philosophical topics, so it was a privilege to have the opportunity -- a transcript of the discussion follows.


Thank you for taking the time to sit down for this, Qubit. Given the complexity and depth of the topic, I was hoping we could jump right in. I first wanted to ask -- where do …</span>

It’s been two years since that last post, so in keeping with tradition, here we go - how does openpilot work?</span>
