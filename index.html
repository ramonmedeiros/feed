Just last week I got one of those really?! ü§® faces when this fact came up in conversation amongst smart and engaged fellow web developers: there is no browser choice on iOS. It‚Äôs all Safari. You can download apps that are named Chrome or Firefox, or anything else, but they are just veneer over Safari. If you‚Äôre viewing a website on iOS, it‚Äôs Safari.

Besides obvious and well-known ones described in books and many blog posts, I realized that the process of writing tests has also psychological effects for me.

Just like the programming language itself, many of the tools that Go engineers use everyday are discussed and developed in the open. In this episode we‚Äôll talk about this team, how it started, where it‚Äôs going, and how you can get involved.

Postgres is, and for some time will continue to be, the first database I turn to. As Postgres focuses on the little things, it just deepens my commitment to it.

So today I wanted to call some extra attention to those little things, the ones that don‚Äôt get the spotlight, but simply make a developer‚Äôs life better.

Security is a cat-and-mouse game. As attackers innovate, browsers always have to mount new defenses to stay ahead, and Chrome has invested in ever-stronger multi-process architecture built on sandboxing and site isolation. Combined with fuzzing, these are still our primary lines of defense, but they are reaching their limits, and we can no longer solely rely on this strategy to defeat in-the-wild attacks.

                <p>Seed is a Rust framework that uses an Elm-like architecture to help you build fast and reliable web apps that run on WebAssembly. Here‚Äôs why you might want to use it:
Seed allows you to develop the front-end with all the benefits of Rust, meaning speed, safety, and too many more things to count.
The Seed templating system uses a macro syntax that makes Rustaceans feel right at home. This means linting, formatting, and commenting will work, and it‚Äôs all in Rust. This is opposed to a JSX-like syntax that reli‚Ä¶</p>

Most applications that worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1 will still work unchanged and will simply need to be recompiled (although you may see numerous compilation warnings about using deprecated APIs). Some applications may need to make changes to compile and work correctly, and many applications will need to be changed to avoid the deprecations warnings.

Kat (and others) put a lot of thought into this.
KDL is a document language with xml-like semantics that looks like you‚Äôre invoking a bunch of CLI commands! It‚Äôs meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration language, much like JSON, YAML, or XML.
Check out the FAQ for all the common objections (like why not YAML or TOML or ETC) as well as a note about the XKCD comic you‚Äôre probably thinking about. Here‚Äôs hopi‚Ä¶</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>On this special edition of The Changelog, we‚Äôre talking with Cory Wilkerson, Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub, about GitHub Codespaces. For years now, the possibility of coding in the cloud seemed so close, yet so far away for a number of reasons. According to Cory, the raw ingredients to make coding in the cloud a reality have been there for years.

David Flanagan, a.k.a. Rawkode, needs no introduction. Some of you may remember Marques Johansson from The new changelog.com setup for 2019. Marques was behind the Linode Terraforming that we used at the time, and our infrastructure was simpler because of it!

                <p>Big news from Deno today.
Today we are releasing Deploy Beta 2. This is the second in a series of beta releases that will be made over the coming months. Each release will add features and refine the programming model. The releases will culminate in a General Availability announcement that we estimate will happen in Q4 2021.
Over the past eight months, we have been quietly designing this hosted service to supplement workflows with the open source Deno CLI. Deploy does not run on AWS Lambda nor does it use C‚Ä¶</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Routing might be implemented in a number of ways: it‚Äôs sometimes code running on a server that maps a path to files on disk, or logic in a single-page app that waits for changes to the current location and creates a corresponding piece of DOM to display.
Buggy routing (and breaking your browser‚Äôs Back button) has been the achilles heel of SPAs since forver. Hopefully better tooling like this URLPattern proposal will help developers better handle the need.

When we encounter emotions and behaviours that don‚Äôt make sense to us, it‚Äôs often because we don‚Äôt have all the information. And in the absence of information, we tend to assume the worst.

                <p>From Shruti Kapoor on PayPal‚Äôs technology blog:
We started our GraphQL adoption journey by building our checkout experience. We saw tremendous benefits in adopting GraphQL when our checkout app built with GraphQL became our guiding light.We built more apps, provided infrastructure support, launched a public GraphQL API, and provided trainings and learning materials across the company. We also set up a standards body, provided a GraphQL tools fanny pack, and built sample apps to help teams get started.
