                    <span>Just wow. This is an impressively hacky hack. You‚Äôre probably wondering how? As many such things do, it all starts with a new (Chrome-only) API:
A new set of APIs affectionately known as Houdini give your browser the power to control CSS via its own Object Model in Javascript. In English, this means that you can make custom CSS styles, add custom properties, and so on‚Ä¶
And it ends with something that looks like this:
main {
  // ...
  --sql-query: SELECT name FROM test;
}

I have often been asked, ‚ÄúWhat is the most memorable bug that you have encountered in your testing career?‚Äù For me, it is hands down a bug that happened quite a few years ago. I was leading an Engineering Productivity team that supported Google App Engine. At that time App Engine was still in its early stages, and there were many challenges associated with testing rapidly evolving features. Our testing frameworks and processes were also evolving, so it was an exciting time to be on the team.¬†


What makes this bug so memorable is that I spent so much time developing a comprehensive suite of test scenarios, yet a failure occurred during such an obvious use case that it left me shaking my head and wondering how I had missed it. Even with many years of testing experience‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>An interesting exploration of Tesla‚Äôs recent update to their in-car control screen that resulted from the author not being able to find the defogger control. Here‚Äôs an example of the kind of analysis he provides:
Edward Tufte has this visual rule that 1+1&#x3D;3. With a single line on the screen, you have just that single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‚Äòobject‚Äô on the screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.
In UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‚Äòobject‚Äô created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap. This cognitive load is invisible and rarely discussed but it can be a real source of confusion.

Two widely used npm libraries were self-sabotaged by their single maintainer, yet again, highlighting the many gaps in our OSS supply chain security, sustainability and overall practices. We explore all these topics and solution on what our ecosystem needs to be more resilient to these types of attacks in the future.

                    <span>I love how much hacking has been inspired by Wordle.
The Wordle source code contains 2,315 days of answers (all common 5-letter English words) and 10,657 other valid, less-common 5-letter English words.
We combine these to form a set of 12,972 possible words/answers.
We then simulate playing 1,000 Wordle games for each of these possible words, guessing based on the frequency of the word in the English language and the feedback received.
Then we take three measures to evaluate the observed distribution of ‚¨õüü®üü© squares on Twitter according to our valid words.
The resulting code is included in the article.

                    <span>Lots of people talk about Kubernets‚Äô complexity, but it‚Äôs rare for someone to attempt to plumb the depths of why exactly that is.
I don‚Äôt claim to have the full answer, but this post is an attempt to commit to paper two specific thoughts or paradigms I have that I reach for as I try to understand why working with Kubernetes feels so hairy sometimes.

They talk about the superpower of observability for developers, how she and Charity Majors got to the place to found Honeycomb, the state of their platform today, what exactly observability is, and their goals for the future of Honeycomb.

While the tooling is impressive, it‚Äôs the principles behind it that captivated Gerhard‚Äôs imagination. Vincent has a rather interesting take on the monorepository idea, including one change - one version - one deploy. There are a lot of interesting links in the show notes, including all the code that Vincent uses to manage infrastructure.
As a result of this conversation, Gerhard is running Nix on one of his Macs, and also started experimenting with his first NixOS production instance.

                    <span>Old as in old school cool not old as in passe:
Despite the new gatekeepers‚Äô best efforts, the old Internet never completely disappeared. Personal websites created by individuals that have always been the meat of the old Internet are still around. They are still about exploration, innovation, fun, and all the rest. Try as the new gatekeepers have, they simply have not had the power to eradicate the old Internet completely. All they can do is pretend it does not exist. And, that is exactly what they do.
But‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ the old Internet seems to be slowly and quietly coming back, and it is coming back even better than before. Now it has better technology and an additional well-defined purpose that it never had before.
Some people have begun to refer to personal websites as the ‚Äúindie web‚Äù, the ‚Äúsmall Internet‚Äù, or the ‚Äúsmol Internet‚Äù. Some seem to reserve the last two terms exclusively for the Gemini Network, which nearly quadrupled in size last year. But, I think all three terms should also apply to some of the other networks that use alternative networking protocols‚Äìthe Gopher Network, the Tor network, and the ZeroNet network, to name a few.

Previously called PolicyKit, Polkit manages system-wide privileges in Unix-like OSes. It provides a mechanism for nonprivileged processes to safely interact with privileged processes. It also allows users to execute commands with high privileges by using a component called pkexec, followed by the command.
Oh my. It requires local access first, which is the only good news here.

                    <span>PRQL (pronounced ‚ÄúPrequel‚Äù) aims to be ‚Äúa simpler and more powerful SQL‚Äù
Like SQL, it‚Äôs readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it transpiles to SQL.
To get an idea on PRQL‚Äôs design, they provide this SQL statement as an example:
SELECT TOP 20
    title,
    country,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,

                    <span>Troy Hunt (of Have I been Pwned fame) has been a vocal proponent of cloud-first services for awhile. Last December, that strategy came back to bite him:
It all started with my monthly Azure bill for December which was way over what it would normally be. It only took a moment to find the problem‚Ä¶
He goes on to tell the tale in excruciating detail. Be careful out there, cloud natives.

                    <span>This week Paul Copplestone, CEO of Supabase joined us to catch us up on the next big thing happening in the world of Postgres. Supabase might be best known as ‚Äúthe open source Firebase alternative,‚Äù a tagline they might be reluctant to maintain. But from Adam‚Äôs perspective, he‚Äôs never been more excited about what they‚Äôre bringing to market for Postgres fans. In the last year, Supabase has gone from 0 to more than 80,000 databases on their platform ‚Äî and they‚Äôre still in beta‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs open source. Hopefully today‚Äôs show sheds some light on why everyone is talking about Supabase.

                    <span>Jesse O‚ÄôBrien from Test Double wants us to stop using the term ‚ÄúTech Debt‚Äù
There‚Äôs loads of reasons why unmaintainable code ends up running in the systems our products are built on, but none of these fit the definition of debt.
Instead, I propose we drop the term Tech Debt and start talking about maintenance tasks. Maintenance is what we‚Äôre really talking about. When parts on our car or bicycle suffers wear from driving them around, we don‚Äôt talk to our mechanic about ‚Äúmechanical debt‚Äù. (Go back and re-read that sentence, but replace things with ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù and ‚Äúprogrammers‚Äù). We talk about maintenance.
This post starts as mostly a semantic debate, and I‚Äôm not convinced by his arguments there. I think the debt metaphor is useful when you‚Äôre talking about trading quality for speed. That‚Äôs what you do when you take on debt: you trade higher cost at a future date (principle + interest) to gain access to the money today (speed).
That being said, I really like where Jesse ends this piece talking about software maintenance and methods of going about it. Lots of actionable advice there and I‚Äôm 100% onboard with talking about software maintenance early and often. One of the first things I consider when somebody approaches me with a feature idea is ask myself: what will this cost to maintain?

After spending some time playing with them, I began to appreciate how generics in Go have been designed and implemented with the same elegance and simplicity as Go itself. I hope you will agree, and to that end, this repository is a hands-on approach to learning all about generics in Go.

                    <span>Gerhard loves simple ideas executed well, which is why he is excited to be speaking today with Ildar Iskhakov &amp; Matvey Kukuy about their startup Amixr, a.k.a. Grafana OnCall.
Ildar &amp; Matvey started with a simple idea and a simple stack - Django, Celery, RabbitMQ &amp; MySQL - all running on Kubernetes. Because they kept their main thing their main thing, and kept improving it every day for a couple of years, now your on-call can be simple too.
This is another Big Tent philosophy story with a Black Swan moment towards the end.

Go‚Äôs design lends itself nicely to computer generated authoring: thanks to go fmt, there‚Äôs already only one Go style. This means AI-generated code will be consistent and seamless. Its focus on simplicity &amp; readability make it tailor made for this new approach to software creation. Where might this take us?

                    <span>Imagine this: you‚Äôve been paged to investigate a production incident, and after some digging, you identify the commit with the breaking code. You decide to revert the change:
git revert 1a2b3c
Unfortunately, in doing so, a new bug is introduced! As it turns out, hidden in that old ‚Äúbroken‚Äù commit was some code that another part of the app depended upon, and when you reverted those lines, it left the site once again in a broken state. üôÉ Oh dear.
How can situations like this be avoided? To answer this question, we first need to examine how these types of commits come to be.
If you‚Äôve never heard of or used git reset‚Ä¶ this article is a must-read.

It costs $0 and no, it‚Äôs not some note-taking or to-do list system.
The steps are:
develop meta-awareness of your state of mind.
pattern-match to identify your mind‚Äôs most common modes.
learn to pick activities that match each mode.
But that probably won‚Äôt hit home until you read through his explanation of each step.

Since our July announcement of Scorecards V2, the Scorecards project‚Äîan automated security tool to flag risky supply chain practices in open source projects‚Äîhas grown steadily to over 40 unique contributors and 18 implemented security checks. Today we are proud to announce the V4 release of Scorecards, with larger scaling, a new security check, and a new Scorecards GitHub Action for easier security automation.
The Scorecards Action is released in partnership with GitHub and is available from GitHub&#x27;s Marketplace. The Action makes using Scorecards easier than ever: it runs automatically on repository changes to alert developers about risky supply-chain practices. Maintainers can view the alerts on GitHub&#x27;s code scanning dashboard, which is available for free to public repositories on GitHub.com and via GitHub Advanced Security for private repositories. 
Additionally, we have scaled our weekly Scorecards scans to over one million GitHub repositories, and have partnered with the Open Source Insights website for easy user access to the data.

                    <span>This week Matt Ahrens joins Adam to talk about ZFS. Matt co-founded the ZFS project at Sun Microsystems in 2001. And 20 years later Adam picked up ZFS for use in his home lab and loved it. So, he reached out to Matt and invited him on the show. They cover the origins of the file system, its journey from proprietary to open source, architecture choices like copy-on-write, the ins and outs creating and managing ZFS, RAID-Z and RAID-Z expansion, and Matt even shares plans for ZFS in the cloud with ZFS object store.

This is not a MySQL vs PostgreSQL post. This is just a small summary of what I have come to appreciate about PostgreSQL as an Infrastructure Engineer.
Always good to keep in mind whenever comparing technologies: trade-offs abound and certain people in certain situations will value certain things about different technologies differently. That‚Äôs for certain. üòâ

MDN relies on contributors to help maintain its ever-expanding and up to date documentation. We reached out to 4 long-time community contributors to talk about how and why they started contributing, why they kept going, and ask what advice they have for new contributors.

                    <span>Daniel Stenberg lays out how he thinks we can view the world of software and open source in light of supply chain security, maintainer sustainability, and the like:
Inside the pyramid there is a hierarchy where things using software are build on top of others, in layers. The higher up you go, the more you stand on the shoulders of open source components below you.
At the very bottom of the pyramid are the foundational components. Operating systems and libraries. The stuff virtually everything runs or depends upon. The components you really don‚Äôt want to have serious security vulnerabilities.

We‚Äôre excited to give new life to this idea and project.
This project can have a fresh start and it will become even cooler.
We felt we needed to do a public announcement because of all of the attention the project received in the media and from the community.
We believe that we have acted in the way that is best for the community.

                    <span>Today Gerhard shares the entire story behind his lost packets. He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider &amp; ISP based in Sussex, UK.
Gerhard‚Äôs Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard‚Äôs DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections. And because nothing beats a real-world experiment, you can guess what is coming in this episode üòâ

                    <span>Genome sequencing can help us better understand, diagnose and treat disease. For example, healthcare providers are increasingly using genome sequencing to diagnose rare genetic diseases, such as elevated risk for breast cancer or pulmonary arterial hypertension, which are estimated to affect roughly 8% of the population.
At Google Health, we‚Äôre applying our technology and expertise to the field of genomics. Here are recent research and industry developments we‚Äôve made to help quickly identify genetic disease and foster the equity of genomic tests across ancestries. This includes an exciting new partnership with Pacific Biosciences to further advance genomic technologies in research and the clinic.

                    <span>Any debugging story that includes the phrase, ‚ÄúMy Mom‚Äôs verbal JIRA ticket was right‚Äù has a lot of promise. This one by Jim Nielsen delivers the goods. Here‚Äôs the culprit:
In my brain, I always thought of Safari and Chrome as ‚Äúmodern‚Äù browsers. But even Chrome, an ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù browser, failed because it wasn‚Äòt on an ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù operating system (or hardware).
and his takeaway:
The real-life impact of our technical decisions really hit home to me once again: my Mom had trouble volunteering and participating in her local community because somebody shipped the optional chaining operator in their production JavaScript.
Be thoughtful out there.

                    <span>At Ace Centre we have just launched an application that uses your webcam to detect when a user blinks. The application then triggers a switch press. This allows users who can‚Äôt access a physical switch or eye tracking to communicate using their chosen communication software.
We are really excited about the real world impact EyeCommander is already having and we would love to have more people contributing to the open source codebase
EyeCommander is an Electron app with a React frontend. It uses Mediapipe, which is a collection of pretrained ML models for landmark detection in videos, provided by Google. It is cross platform so you can get up and running on whatever platform you use.

                    <span>Your first thought when reading that headline might‚Äôve been _WebAssembly. Mine was! But no, that is not how Browsix does its thing:
Browsix is a framework that bridges the considerable gap between conventional operating systems and the browser, enabling unmodified programs expecting a Unix-like environment to run directly in the browser. Browsix does this by mapping low-level Unix primitives, like processes and system calls, onto existing browser APIs, like Web Workers and postMessage.
They have examples of this tech enabling a terminal in the browser, a Latex editor, and even a client/server-based meme generator written in JS and Go.

We just discussed this topic (and some apprehension about it) on JS Party last week. Definitely a trned worth brushing up on, if you haven‚Äôt already.

                    <span>Fireship with a brief (3:48) rundown of the most recent instance of a popular open source library maintainer removing their code from public repositories in response to corporate (ab)use of their free labor:
Yesterday, a popular open-source package, Faker.js, was abruptly taken down from GitHub. Its readme simply said ‚ÄúWhat really happened to Aaron Swartz?‚Äù. Let‚Äôs take a look at why Open Source Software can be a bad deal for many independent developers.

After graduating from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Abigail made it through the competitive process to become an AI resident at Google Research, Accra. After her residency, Google offered her a job and she‚Äôs now a research software engineer working on several high-profile projects.
As Google grows its presence in Accra, we spoke to Abigail about the mapping project that motivates her, starting a new job while becoming a mother and the importance of inspiring young girls to enter STEM careers.

                    <span>B. Cameron Gain on The New Stack:
Despite an ample amount of documentation and demos made available by Grafana Labs and community members, Grafana can be a challenge to set up (although those that do get its dashboards working generally sing its praises). Many manual configurations and steps are required when installing the different dashboard options. Once installed, many users can be overwhelmed with the number of logs and other data to process for monitoring and observability.
Grafana sure does produce pretty (useful) dashboards üëá, but I do find it overwhelming at times.

                    <span>Martin Heinz on the tools/techniques for finding bottlenecks in your Python code. And fixing them, fast.
The first rule of optimization is to not do it. If you really have to though, then optimize where appropriate. Use the above profiling tools to find bottlenecks, so you don‚Äôt waste time optimizing some inconsequential piece of code. It‚Äôs also useful to create a reproducible benchmark for the piece of code you‚Äôre trying to optimize, so that you can measure the actual improvement.
