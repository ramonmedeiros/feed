                    <span>Gerhard loves simple ideas executed well, which is why he is excited to be speaking today with Ildar Iskhakov &amp; Matvey Kukuy about their startup Amixr, a.k.a. Grafana OnCall.
Ildar &amp; Matvey started with a simple idea and a simple stack - Django, Celery, RabbitMQ &amp; MySQL - all running on Kubernetes. Because they kept their main thing their main thing, and kept improving it every day for a couple of years, now your on-call can be simple too.
This is another Big Tent philosophy story with a Black Swan moment towards the end.

Go‚Äôs design lends itself nicely to computer generated authoring: thanks to go fmt, there‚Äôs already only one Go style. This means AI-generated code will be consistent and seamless. Its focus on simplicity &amp; readability make it tailor made for this new approach to software creation. Where might this take us?

                    <span>Imagine this: you‚Äôve been paged to investigate a production incident, and after some digging, you identify the commit with the breaking code. You decide to revert the change:
git revert 1a2b3c
Unfortunately, in doing so, a new bug is introduced! As it turns out, hidden in that old ‚Äúbroken‚Äù commit was some code that another part of the app depended upon, and when you reverted those lines, it left the site once again in a broken state. üôÉ Oh dear.
How can situations like this be avoided? To answer this question, we first need to examine how these types of commits come to be.
If you‚Äôve never heard of or used git reset‚Ä¶ this article is a must-read.

I recently discovered a simple step-by-step process that significantly increased my personal productivity and made me happier along the way.
It costs $0 and no, it‚Äôs not some note-taking or to-do list system.
The steps are:
develop meta-awareness of your state of mind.
pattern-match to identify your mind‚Äôs most common modes.
learn to pick activities that match each mode.
But that probably won‚Äôt hit home until you read through his explanation of each step.

Since our July announcement of Scorecards V2, the Scorecards project‚Äîan automated security tool to flag risky supply chain practices in open source projects‚Äîhas grown steadily to over 40 unique contributors and 18 implemented security checks. Today we are proud to announce the V4 release of Scorecards, with larger scaling, a new security check, and a new Scorecards GitHub Action for easier security automation.
The Scorecards Action is released in partnership with GitHub and is available from GitHub&#x27;s Marketplace. The Action makes using Scorecards easier than ever: it runs automatically on repository changes to alert developers about risky supply-chain practices. Maintainers can view the alerts on GitHub&#x27;s code scanning dashboard, which is available for free to public repositories on GitHub.com and via GitHub Advanced Security for private repositories. 
Additionally, we have scaled our weekly Scorecards scans to over one million GitHub repositories, and have partnered with the Open Source Insights website for easy user access to the data. 
For more details about the release, including the new Dangerous-Workflow security check, visit the OpenSSF&#x27;s official blog post here.</span>

And 20 years later Adam picked up ZFS for use in his home lab and loved it. So, he reached out to Matt and invited him on the show. They cover the origins of the file system, its journey from proprietary to open source, architecture choices like copy-on-write, the ins and outs creating and managing ZFS, RAID-Z and RAID-Z expansion, and Matt even shares plans for ZFS in the cloud with ZFS object store.

Always good to keep in mind whenever comparing technologies: trade-offs abound and certain people in certain situations will value certain things about different technologies differently. That‚Äôs for certain. üòâ

                    <span>If you‚Äôre using GitHub as your version control system of choice then GitHub Apps can be incredibly useful for many tasks including building CI/CD, managing repositories, querying statistical data and much more. In this article we will walk through the process of building such an app in Go including setting up the GitHub integration, authenticating with GitHub, listening to webhooks, querying GitHub API and more.

For years I‚Äôve been noticing this pattern of infrastructure engineers I really respect preferring MySQL and product engineers preferring Postgres. It took quite a while for me to understand it. Especially coming from my background as a product engineer. Infrastructure engineers generally‚Ä¶

                    <span>Daniel Stenberg lays out how he thinks we can view the world of software and open source in light of supply chain security, maintainer sustainability, and the like:
Inside the pyramid there is a hierarchy where things using software are build on top of others, in layers. The higher up you go, the more you stand on the shoulders of open source components below you.
At the very bottom of the pyramid are the foundational components. Operating systems and libraries. The stuff virtually everything runs or depends upon. The components you really don‚Äôt want to have serious security vulnerabilities.

                    <span>Jim Hall used grep and some fancy regular expressions to get a leg up on Wordle, the word game that keeps you guessing‚Ä¶ but only once per day. Some people may think of Jim‚Äôs technique as cheating. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily disagree.
But it‚Äôs a lot better than View Source-ing to get at the answer, which you can also do in a pinch. üòâ
(Also there‚Äôs zero point to Wordle other than having fun, so it‚Äôs really only cheating if your answer-finding-method is less fun than you‚Äôd have otherwise. Even then, you‚Äôre only cheating yourself.)

We‚Äôre excited to give new life to this idea and project.
This project can have a fresh start and it will become even cooler.
We felt we needed to do a public announcement because of all of the attention the project received in the media and from the community.
We believe that we have acted in the way that is best for the community.

Now that PlanetScale is in general availability, Adam had to get Sam on the show to talk about the behind the scenes of building this database platform, how this is the last database you‚Äôll ever need and what that means for developers, why serverless, its open source underpinnings with Vitess, and a preview of what‚Äôs to come.

                    <span>Funny how stuff like this plays out sometimes:
My cog tool has been having a resurgence of late: a number of people are discovering it‚Äôs useful to run a little bit of Python code inside otherwise static files.
He goes on to list out a bunch of tweets from people finding it useful for various tasks and even got to talk about the project on podcast.__init__. Cool tool, cool story.

                    <span>Today Gerhard shares the entire story behind his lost packets. He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider &amp; ISP based in Sussex, UK.
Gerhard‚Äôs Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard‚Äôs DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections. And because nothing beats a real-world experiment, you can guess what is coming in this episode üòâ

                    <span>Genome sequencing can help us better understand, diagnose and treat disease. For example, healthcare providers are increasingly using genome sequencing to diagnose rare genetic diseases, such as elevated risk for breast cancer or pulmonary arterial hypertension, which are estimated to affect roughly 8% of the population.
At Google Health, we‚Äôre applying our technology and expertise to the field of genomics. Here are recent research and industry developments we‚Äôve made to help quickly identify genetic disease and foster the equity of genomic tests across ancestries. This includes an exciting new partnership with Pacific Biosciences to further advance genomic technologies in research and the clinic.

                    <span>Any debugging story that includes the phrase, ‚ÄúMy Mom‚Äôs verbal JIRA ticket was right‚Äù has a lot of promise. This one by Jim Nielsen delivers the goods. Here‚Äôs the culprit:
In my brain, I always thought of Safari and Chrome as ‚Äúmodern‚Äù browsers. But even Chrome, an ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù browser, failed because it wasn‚Äòt on an ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù operating system (or hardware).
and his takeaway:
The real-life impact of our technical decisions really hit home to me once again: my Mom had trouble volunteering and participating in her local community because somebody shipped the optional chaining operator in their production JavaScript.
Be thoughtful out there.

                    <span>At Ace Centre we have just launched an application that uses your webcam to detect when a user blinks. The application then triggers a switch press. This allows users who can‚Äôt access a physical switch or eye tracking to communicate using their chosen communication software.
We are really excited about the real world impact EyeCommander is already having and we would love to have more people contributing to the open source codebase
EyeCommander is an Electron app with a React frontend. It uses Mediapipe, which is a collection of pretrained ML models for landmark detection in videos, provided by Google. It is cross platform so you can get up and running on whatever platform you use.

                    <span>Your first thought when reading that headline might‚Äôve been _WebAssembly. Mine was! But no, that is not how Browsix does its thing:
Browsix is a framework that bridges the considerable gap between conventional operating systems and the browser, enabling unmodified programs expecting a Unix-like environment to run directly in the browser. Browsix does this by mapping low-level Unix primitives, like processes and system calls, onto existing browser APIs, like Web Workers and postMessage.
They have examples of this tech enabling a terminal in the browser, a Latex editor, and even a client/server-based meme generator written in JS and Go.

                    <span>Chip Huyen:
In the last year, I‚Äôve talked to ~30 companies in different industries about their challenges with real-time machine learning. I‚Äôve also worked with quite a few to find the solutions. This post outlines the solutions for (1) online prediction and (2) continual learning, with step-by-step use cases, considerations, and technologies required for each level.

                    <span>As a university student, Abigail Annkah fell in love with mathematics, which soon led to her interest in artificial intelligence. After graduating from the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Abigail made it through the competitive process to become an AI resident at Google Research, Accra. After her residency, Google offered her a job and she‚Äôs now a research software engineer working on several high-profile projects.
As Google grows its presence in Accra, we spoke to Abigail about the mapping project that motivates her, starting a new job while becoming a mother and the importance of inspiring young girls to enter STEM careers.

                    <span>B. Cameron Gain on The New Stack:
Despite an ample amount of documentation and demos made available by Grafana Labs and community members, Grafana can be a challenge to set up (although those that do get its dashboards working generally sing its praises). Many manual configurations and steps are required when installing the different dashboard options. Once installed, many users can be overwhelmed with the number of logs and other data to process for monitoring and observability.
Grafana sure does produce pretty (useful) dashboards üëá, but I do find it overwhelming at times.

                    <span>Martin Heinz on the tools/techniques for finding bottlenecks in your Python code. And fixing them, fast.
The first rule of optimization is to not do it. If you really have to though, then optimize where appropriate. Use the above profiling tools to find bottlenecks, so you don‚Äôt waste time optimizing some inconsequential piece of code. It‚Äôs also useful to create a reproducible benchmark for the piece of code you‚Äôre trying to optimize, so that you can measure the actual improvement.

                    <span>In our first 2022 episode, Alexis Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Weaveworks, is talking to Gerhard about going fully remote, what a great team looks like, and GitOps. While you may have heard of GitOps, now is a good time to check out opengitops.dev.
The most interesting part of today‚Äôs conversation is the missing cloud native App Store. While Apple revolutionised the world with the App Store and the iPhone, we don‚Äôt yet have something similar for cloud native apps. You may be thinking ‚ÄúBut what about OperatorHub?‚Äù, or all the Helm registries out there? The registry fragmentation, operator deprecations and lack of curation are not what people have in mind when they think App Store. But there is more to it, so let‚Äôs hear how Alexis thinks about this.

                    <span>Back in the olden days, I would just put a mysqldump &gt; dump.sql in a crontab and called it a day. When I started to host more and more stuff with docker, I first just migrated that approach to docker and put it all in a container. That still required me to mess around with config files. Once I started to host postgres containers it all got even more complicated. Thus, I needed a new solution.
I built this tool to make backups easy: Simply point it to a host running docker containers and it will automatically inspect and find all mysql/mariadb and postgres containers and do backups of them on a schedule. No configuration required, it ‚Äújust works‚Äù.

                    <span>Previously, we compiled a Go program into a WebAssembly and then converted it into C++ files to make it run on Nintendo Switch. Now, I have succeeded in compiling a Go program into a native binary for Nintendo Switch, and also running a game there. I replaced system calls with C function calls using the -overlay option.

                    <span>Oliver Brotchie developed this CSS fingerprinting technique that requires no Javascript or Cookies to function and avoids anti-tracking methods such as NoScript, VPNs or browser extensions.
CSS Fingerprinting is a technique of tracking and gathering information on site visitors. This method exploits the nature of CSS to track various characteristics about the visitor‚Äôs browser and device, which can later be used to either identify or track said visitor.
Right now, at current spec, this method doesn‚Äôt scale, but with the next upcoming draft of the CSS specification, CSS Values 4, it will become far more scalable and precise.

Without dura, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state. That‚Äôs so 2021. Computers crash and Ctrl-Z only works on files independently. Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can revert to ‚Äú4 hours ago‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever‚Äù. Finally, some sanity.
This sounds a lot like how Fossil works out of the box, except maybe even more paranoid because Fossil will propagate every commit whereas Dura propagates all changes even before they‚Äôre committed.

This looks like a fine open source alternative. I‚Äôll give it a try and report back.

                    <span>RSS-Bridge is a PHP project capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don‚Äôt have one. It can be used on webservers or as a stand-alone application in CLI mode.
I made a very poor-man‚Äôs version of this as my first ever Sinatra app way back in the day. It‚Äôs cool to see that vision live on, but it sucks that tools like this have to exist. It seems that the author agrees with me on that:
We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have your service with your applications using your API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.
We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

                    <span>OpenDrop is a command-line tool that allows sharing files between devices directly over Wi-Fi. Its unique feature is that it is protocol-compatible with Apple AirDrop which allows to share files with Apple devices running iOS and macOS.
Super cool, but with a disclaimer: this is the result of reverse engineering the transfer protocol, so the odds of it being flakey (especially as Apple ships OS updates) are high. It‚Äôd be rad if Apple would publish an AirDrop-compatible specification for the community to rally around.
You know, like they did with FaceTime. üòâ

Despite ongoing global challenges, we‚Äôve made significant progress in our effort to build a fully error-corrected quantum computer, working towards our next hardware milestone of building an error-corrected quantum bit (qubit) prototype. At the same time, we have continued our commitment to realizing the potential of quantum computers in various applications. That&#x27;s why we published results in top journals, collaborated with researchers across academia and industry, and expanded our team to bring on new talent and expertise.
