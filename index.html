                    <span>Hello 2024! We’re kicking off the year with Dan Moore, author of ‘Letters to a New Developer’ — a blog series of letters of what Dan wished he had known when starting his developer career. We discuss the value of online communities for new developers, the importance of communication skills, and the need to stay relevant in a rapidly changing industry. Dan shares his best advice for new developers, including the importance of saying no, leaving code better than you found it, and the value of skill stacking. So much wisdom and advice in this episode!

                    <span>In the 14+ years we’ve been making The Changelog podcast, it has never gone viral.
We’ve had popular  episodes and not so popular episodes. We’ve made episodes we love and episodes listeners love. But we’ve never had a viral moment like Elon Musk smoking weed or Jeff Bezos talking Blue Origin on our show.
I’m not here to complain about that!
We’ve had tons of success with our shows and I’m super grateful that we get to make awesome developer pods for a living. I do think the fact is interesting, though, and worth exploring. Hopefully this exploration is an encouragement to other folks who record deep conversations for niche audiences like we do.
Maybe we can&#x27;t go viral because we still like memes from the early 2000s...

To debug why our podcast has never gone viral, we should troubleshoot…</span>

                    <span>Daniel Ehrenberg (software engineer at Bloomberg, web standards author / champion &amp; VP of ECMA International) joins us to discuss new features that have landed in JavaScript and to preview what’s cooking in various standards bodies across the web platform.
We cover a wide array (get it?) of topics from improvements to built-ins such as Promises, Maps &amp; Sets, as well as new primitives like Records, Tuples &amp; Temporal. We round out this epic discussion with a look at cross-project standardization efforts like WinterCG, open source sustainability &amp; how Bloomberg’s open source program gives back in important projects in the web ecosystem.

                    <span>Jerod’s Note: The short embedded below of Tammer Saleh on Ship It! created a firestorm of comments from folks who were unsatisfied with the lack of explanation behind his conclusion.

  
I caught up with Tammer at KubeCon NA 2023 and took the opportunity to ask him to clarify and defend the comment. This post is a fancied-up transcript of his response.

Comments can be invaluable for understanding and maintaining a code base.  But excessive comments in code can become unhelpful clutter full of extraneous and/or outdated detail. 
Comments that offer useless (or worse, obsolete) information hurt readability. Here are some tips to let your code speak for itself:

Android’s defense-in-depth strategy applies not only to the Android OS running on the Application Processor (AP) but also the firmware that runs on devices. We particularly prioritize hardening the cellular baseband given its unique combination of running in an elevated privilege and parsing untrusted inputs that are remotely delivered into the device.


This post covers how to use two high-value sanitizers which can prevent specific classes of vulnerabilities found within the baseband. They are architecture agnostic, suitable for bare-metal deployment, and should be enabled in existing C/C++ code bases to mitigate unknown vulnerabilities. Beyond security, addressing the issues uncovered by these sanitizers improves code health and overall s…</span>
