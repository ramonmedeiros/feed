In this episode they will chat through the challenges and how they overcame them, focusing specifically on the wait strategy for their ML Pipeline Healthcare Solution microservices. We’ll also touch on how improvements were made to an open source Go package as part of this project.

For 13 years, a key pillar of the Chrome Security ecosystem has included encouraging security researchers to find security vulnerabilities in Chrome browser and report them to us, through the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program.


Starting today and until 1 December 2023, the first security bug report we receive with a functional full chain exploit, resulting in a Chrome sandbox escape, is eligible for triple the full reward amount. Your full chain exploit could result in a reward up to $180,000 (potentially more with other bonuses).


 


Any subsequent full chains submitted during this time are eligible for double the full reward amount! 


We have historically put a premium on reports with exploits –  “high quality report…</span>

In this episode, Chris interviews Daniel about his new company called Prediction Guard, which addresses these issues. They discuss some practical methodologies for getting consistent, structured output from compliant AI systems. These systems, driven by open access models and various kinds of LLM wrappers, can help you delight customers AND navigate the increasing restrictions on “GPT” models.

Introduction


Chrome is trusted by millions of business users as a secure enterprise browser. Organizations can use Chrome Browser Cloud Management to help manage Chrome browsers more effectively. As an admin, they can use the Google Admin console to get Chrome to report critical security events to third-party service providers such as Splunk® to create custom enterprise security remediation workflows.


Security remediation is the process of responding to security events that have been triggered by a system or a user. Remediation can be done manually or automatically, and it is an important part of an enterprise security program.


Why is Automated Security Remediation Important?


When a security event is identified, it is imperative to re…</span>

It’s Google CTF time! Get your hacking toolbox ready and prepare your caffeine for rapid intake. The competition kicks off on June 23 2023 6:00 PM UTC and runs through June 25 2023 6:00 PM UTC. Registration is now open at g.co/ctf.





Google CTF gives you a chance to challenge your skillz, show off your hacktastic abilities, and learn some new tricks along the way. It consists of a set of computer security puzzles (or challenges) involving reverse-engineering, memory corruption, cryptography, web technologies, and more. Use obscure security knowledge to find exploits through bugs and creative misuse. With each completed challenge your team will earn points and move up through the ranks.

Nobody likes preventable site errors, but they happen disappointingly often. 



The last thing you want your customers to see is a dreaded &#x27;Your connection is not private&#x27; error instead of the service they expected to reach. Most certificate errors are preventable and one of the best ways to help prevent issues is by automating your certificate lifecycle using the ACME standard. Google Trust Services now offers our ACME API to all users with a Google Cloud account (referred to as “users” here), allowing them to automatically acquire and renew publicly-trusted TLS certificates for free. The ACME API has been available as a preview and over 200 million certificates have been issued already, offering the same c…</span>

                    <span>The late, great Fred Brooks wrote many words about software engineering. You may have heard of Brooks’s Law or read his seminal book, The Mythical Man-Month. Even if you haven’t, you’ve probably heard at least one colleague proclaim:
Nine women can’t make a baby in one month!
This is a powerful metaphor for two reasons. First: it’s so vivid that it’s hard to forget (and easy to recall in a time of need). Second: it makes obvious a not-so-obvious conclusion. Which is:
Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
That’s a hard pill to swallow, especially when your project is late. But it’s a truth pill, which makes it worth choking down. Here’s another truth pill that Brooks wrote in his paper No Silver Bullet–Essence and Accident in Software Engineering:

Today, we are announcing the launch of the v0.1 version of Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC). Introduced at Kubecon 2022 in October, GUAC targets a critical need in the software industry to understand the software supply chain. In collaboration with Kusari, Purdue University, Citi, and community members, we have incorporated feedback from our early testers to improve GUAC and make it more useful for security professionals.

                    <span>Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to amaze us with their capabilities. However, the utilization of LLMs in production AI applications requires the integration of private data. Join us as we have a captivating conversation with Jerry Liu from LlamaIndex, where he provides valuable insights into the process of data ingestion, indexing, and query specifically tailored for LLM applications. Delving into the topic, we uncover different query patterns and venture beyond the realm of vector databases.

Certificates are issued by trusted entities called “Certification Authorities” (CAs).
