                    <span>Simon Willison explains what it is:
Stable Diffusion is a new “text-to-image diffusion model” that was released to the public by Stability.ai six days ago, on August 22nd.
It’s similar to models like Open AI’s DALL-E, but with one crucial difference: they released the whole thing.
And why it’s a really big deal:
In just a few days, there has been an explosion of innovation around it. The things people are building are absolutely astonishing.
He then details some of the innovation and it is staggering, to say the least. Open FTW!

                    <span>Why do we think StatefulSets are broken? Well, if you run through the operational needs of a stateful workload in your head, there’s one key component that you might notice is missing:
What do you do when you need to resize the underlying disk?
The dataset is a common database store that typically grows at a pretty constant positive rate. Unless you support horizontal scaling and partitioning, you’ll need to add headroom in the disk as that dataset grows.
This is where Kubernetes falls flat on its face.

In today’s episode, we talk to Ganeshkumar, a Software Engineer in the Azure Kubernetes Service team, who works on Node Lifecycle and Kubernetes Versioning, and Brendan, Kubernetes project co-founder and engineering Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Azure OSS and Cloud-native Compute. We talk about what it’s like to work for Microsoft, how mentoring works in practice, and what Kubernetes, Omega, &amp; Borg have to do with it all.

The ideas behind the DevOps movements undeniably changed the software development world for the better - but by now, the term “DevOps” has lost all meaning.
According to Lane, some companies believe in DevOps ideas, but are unwilling to invest in changing their ways. Others aren’t convinced that some of the “scarier” ideas are all that helpful.

                    <span>Julia Evans shares five things you can do to getting better at debugging, which is a critical skill for everyone in tech! They are:
learn the codebase
learn the system
learn your tools
learn strategies
get experience
Each thing comes with an explanation and she shares a great quote at the end (from a paper she extracted these things from):
Their findings did not show a significant difference in the strategies employed by the novices and experts. Experts simply formed more correct hypotheses and were more efficient at finding the fault. The authors suspect that this result is due to the difference in the programming experience between novices and experts.

In this article I will try to convince you that the walrus operator really is a good addition to the language and that if you use it properly, then it can help you make your code more concise and readable.

                    <span>maps.earth is a planet-scale installation of Headway, but you can easily set up your own server on a smaller scale for your own personal use by running just a few commands.
This is the first I’ve heard of Headway, but I love their mission:
The Headway Project was born out of a frustration with the need to send current and future location data to a corporation in order to figure out how we’re getting from A to B. Offline-only maps apps can be frustrating to use, and sometimes suffer from performance problems, poor data coverage, or other technical limitations.
Headway aims to remedy these issues by bundling industry-standard software into a web app that’s easy to set up for yourself or your friends. No need to send your location data to anyone you don’t trust, not even maps.earth.

                    <span>In this Fully-Connected episode, Daniel and Chris discuss concerns of privacy in the face of ever-improving AI / ML technologies.  Evaluating AI’s impact on privacy from various angles, they note that ethical AI practitioners and data scientists have an enormous burden, given that much of the general population may not understand the implications of the data privacy decisions of everyday life.
This intentionally thought-provoking conversation advocates consideration and action from each listener when it comes to evaluating how their own activities either protect or violate the privacy of those whom they impact.

                    <span>Having a smaller website makes it load faster — that’s not surprising.
What is surprising is that a 14kB page can load much faster than a 15kB page — maybe 612ms faster — while the difference between a 15kB and a 16kB page is trivial.
The reason for this is because of how TCP works, which is nicely explained in the post. But is 14kB even a feasible reality? The author thinks so:
That 14kB includes compression — so it could actually be more like ~50kB of uncompressed data — which is generous. Consider that the Apollo 11 guidance computers only had 72kB of memory.
Once you lose the autoplaying videos, the popups, the cookies, the cookie consent banners, the social network buttons, the tracking scripts, javascript and css frameworks, and all the other junk nobody likes — you’re probably there.

Today, we are launching Google’s Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program (OSS VRP) to reward discoveries of vulnerabilities in Google’s open source projects. As the maintainer of major projects such as Golang, Angular, and Fuchsia, Google is among the largest contributors and users of open source in the world. With the addition of Google’s OSS VRP to our family of Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs), researchers can now be rewarded for finding bugs that could potentially impact the entire open source ecosystem.

Google has been committed to supporting security researchers and bug hunters for over a decade. The original VRP program, established to compensate and thank those who help make Google’s code mo…</span>

By now they burnt $500K and were left with only $100K. They wanted to tryout something for one last time with the $100K. One of their Co-Founders suggested that they try to productise their open source library. Peter, the Co-Founder &amp; CEO didn’t like that idea at all. This open-source library had only 580 lines of code, compared to the other 2 products which had 100x more lines of code and a very grand vision on how to define an industry.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Alex MacCaw — he’s well known for his work as founder and CEO of Clearbit. In May of 2021, Alex shared a personal update with the world on his blog. After much reflection, he decided to step down as CEO of Clerabit to go back to his roots. In his words, “I love the early stages of company building. Hacking together code, setting up the Stripe account, getting the first customer. That’s my jam.”
We talk with Alex about this portion of his journey at Clearbit, the Catamaran he bought in South Africa and then sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and the new thing he’s building called Reflect that let’s you keep track of your notes, books, and meetings.

                    <span>Well, the end of Moore’s law has forced YouTube to make its own video chip. General purpose processors we’re cutting for the specialized task of video transcoding, and after a 10 minute meeting with YouTube chief Susan Wojcicki, the company’s first video chip project was approved.
The obvious motive for building your own chip for a specific purpose is cost savings, but that’s not always the case. In many instances, big tech companies are simply looking to create a strategic advantage with custom chips. Consolidation in the chip industry also plays into the equation, as there are now only a couple of custom chipmakers to choose from in a given category making general-purpose processors that aren’t great at specialized tasks.
Google said the Argos VCUs delivered a performance boost of anywhere between 20 to 33 times compared to traditional server hardware running well-tuned transcoding software.

                    <span>This is pure gold!
Add a single line to the /etc/pam.d/sudo file and BAM! You’re sudo’ing with TouchID or your Apple Watch. The only downside is this file is somewhat protected by macOS. When the OS updates, you might need to add the line back to the file. Other than that, it works perfectly!

                    <span>Most of our audience knows that we operate on the mantra “Slow and steady wins,” and yet there’s lessons to be learned by reading a post adjudicating the need to “Move fast or die.” Let me explain…
There’s a key phrase that sets this post and its lessons apart from us here at Changelog Media — it’s “Here’s how we did it at Facebook.” Clearly, we are not Facebook, so we should not operate on advice that’s focused on Facebook. However, we can learn something.
Of the the five lessons shared, each can be appreciated, but one in particular stands out.
We embraced asking for forgiveness, never for permission.
This, to me, is synonymous with “Hire people smarter than you,” because it assumes everyone can bring something to the table that former wisdom might not. It gives permission to try something new and see if something beautiful comes as a result. That’s a good thing.

                    <span>As AI technologies continue to advance, they have the potential to unlock new experiences that support more natural human-computer interactions. We see a future where you can find the information you’re looking for in the same conversational way you speak to friends and family. While there’s still lots of work to be done before this type of human-computer interaction is possible, recent research breakthroughs in generative language models — inspired by the natural conversations of people — are accelerating our progress. One of our most promising models is called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), and as we move ahead with development, we feel a great responsibility to get this right.


That’s why we introduced an app called AI Test Kitchen at Google I/O earlier this year. It…</span>

Here’s what they announced:
They launched an interactive product roadmap on GitHub
They are focusing on mission critical and will discontinue free product plans and delete inactive accounts
They are starting a program to support students and nonprofits
They will continue to contribute to open source projects, notably Cloud Native Buildpacks and offering Heroku credits to select open source projects through Salesforce’s Open Source Program Office (OSPO)

DuckDuckGo Email Protection is a free email forwarding service that removes multiple types of hidden email trackers and lets you create unlimited unique private email addresses on the fly. You can use Email Protection with your current email provider and app – no need to update your contacts or juggle multiple accounts. Email Protection works seamlessly in the background to deliver your more-private emails right to your inbox.
Email tracking and spam is at an all time insanity level. As someone who gets a ton of email daily, most of which is noise and not signal, the problem of email tracking could not hit closer to home

Around 2014, Facebook achieved a 10x performance improvement by replacing their traditional load balancers with eBPF. In 2017, every single packet that went to Facebook was processed by eBPF. Nowadays, every Android phone is using it. Truth be told, if it’s network-related and it matters, eBPF is most likely a part of it.

                    <span>Differentiating between what is real versus what is fake on the internet can be challenging.  Historically, AI deepfakes have only added to the confusion and chaos, but when labeled and intended for good, deepfakes can be extremely helpful.  But with all of the misinformation surrounding deepfakes, it can be hard to see the benefits they bring.  Lior Hakim, CTO at Hour One, joins Chris and Daniel to shed some light on the practical uses of deepfakes.  He addresses the AI technology behind deepfakes, how to make positive use of deep fakes such as breaking down communications barriers, and shares how Hour One specializes in the development of virtual humans for use in professional video communications.

Paranoid is a project to detect well-known weaknesses in large amounts of crypto artifacts, like public keys and digital signatures. On August 3rd 2022 we open sourced the library containing the checks that we implemented so far (https://github.com/google/paranoid_crypto). The library is developed and maintained by members of the Google Security Team, but it is not an officially supported Google product.
Why the Project?
Crypto artifacts may be generated by systems with implementations unknown to us; we refer to them as “black boxes.” An artifact may be generated by a black-box if, for example, it was not generated by one of our own tools (such as Tink), or by a library that we can inspect and test usi…</span>

Adam was invited by our friends at Square to host a fireside chat with Jack Dorsey as the featured finale of their annual developer conference called Square Unboxed. Jack is one of the most prolific CEOs out there. He’s a hacker turned CEO, often working at the very edge of what’s to come. He’s focused on what the future has to offer and an innovator at scale. He’s also a Bitcoin maximalist and has positioned himself and Block long on Bitcoin.

                    <span>Felix Krause built an iOS browser app that lists the JavaScript commands executed by the iOS app rendering the page. Use it like this:
Open an app you want to analyze
Share the URL somewhere inside the app (e.g. send a DM to a friend, or post to your feed)
Tap on the link inside the app to open it
Read the report on the screen
His findings after using this for a bit are… concerning. Especially TikTok.

                    <span>If you’re like me, you may have noticed that AI has become a part of daily life. I wake up each morning and ask my smart assistant about the weather. I recently applied for a new credit card and the credit limit was likely determined by a machine learning model. And while typing the previous sentence, I got a word choice suggestion that “probably” might flow better than “likely,” a suggestion powered by AI.


As a member of Google’s Responsible Innovation team, I think a lot about how AI works and how to develop it responsibly. Recently, I spoke with Patrick Gage Kelley, Head of Research Strategy on Google’s Trust &amp; Safety team, to learn more about developing products that help people recognize and understand AI in their daily lives.

We need young people in the software development industry. Because of their vigour and inexperience, they’ll push the envelope. Most will fail to do the impossible, but a few succeed.
And why we also need old people in the software industry:
We need old people because they’re in a position to speak truth to the world… Old people have less on the line, so they can speak more freely. If someone you used to admire retires and all of a sudden starts saying or writing unpleasant and surprising things, there might be a good explanation, and it might be a good idea to pay attention.

                    <span>The screens in modern cars keep getting bigger. Design teams at most car manufacturers love to ditch physical buttons and switches, although they are far superior safety-wise.
That is the conclusion when Swedish car magazine Vi Bilägare performed a thorough test of the HMI system (Human-Machine Interface) in a total of twelve cars this summer.
Hopefully studies like this will convince car makers to install both a big, sexy touchscreen display and physical buttons for key functions that need to be performed quickly and often. Unfortunately, right now it seems most manufacturers are following Tesla’s lead to a buttonless future. And they pair that move with worse software, too. I’m looking at you, Ford. 👀

                    <span>Craig Kerstiens:
Today I’m excited to introduce a new place for devs to polish their Postgres skills, a Postgres playground from Crunchy Data. What is the playground? Put simply it is:
Postgres running in your local web browser
With canned datasets you can load
Guided tutorials to follow along to learn about the power of Postgres
Since it’s running in the browser you can only connect to it using the embedded psql interface provided. So, it’s not actually useful for real workloads, but it is useful for learning and experimenting.

                    <span>Alexander Wales:
This image was created by an AI, MidJourney. All I had to do was type in a prompt (“wildfire”) and aspect ratio. This AI is pretty good, but nowhere near the state of the art, and AI like it are, over the next few years, going to make art like this available within seconds at a cost of pennies. This applies not just to “art” like the above, which is going to accompany my prose and worldbuilding projects, but to almost every area of life where you see pictures of any kind. I think it’s hard to understate how big of a deal this will end up being, and this blog post is largely my attempt to collate a lot of the arguments under one roof, in part because some of the arguments aren’t actually arguments at all.

                    <span>Josh Comeau takes times to answer the question that many of us have asked ourselves, but never sought out an answer to: exactly how does React’s re-rendering process work?
There are a lot of misconceptions out there about this topic, and it can lead to a lot of uncertainty. If we don’t understand React’s render cycle, how can we understand how to use React.memo, or when we should wrap our functions in useCallback?

                    <span>Even the simplest human tasks are unbelievably complex. The way we perceive and interact with the world requires a lifetime of accumulated experience and context. For example, if a person tells you, “I am running out of time,” you don’t immediately worry they are jogging on a street where the space-time continuum ceases to exist. You understand that they’re probably coming up against a deadline. And if they hurriedly walk toward a closed door, you don’t brace for a collision, because you trust this person can open the door, whether by turning a knob or pulling a handle.


A robot doesn’t innately have that understanding. And that’s the inherent challenge of programming helpful robots that can interact with humans. We know it as “Moravec&#x27;s paradox” — the idea that in robotics, it’s the easi…</span>

                    <span>Daniel and Chris cover the AI news of the day in this wide-ranging discussion. They start with Truss from Baseten while addressing how to categorize AI infrastructure and tools. Then they move on to transformers (again!), and somehow arrive at an AI pilot model from CMU that can navigate crowded airspace (much to Chris’s delight).

                    <span>Every so often, engineers need to pick up a new language. After ~6 years of professional development using Java, with a bit of Ruby sprinkled in, coming to Deliveroo meant that I’d be starting to work on some Go codebases.
So when it came to accepting the offer, I ended up thinking about getting started with learning Go, so I could hit the ground running. In this post I share different ways to get practical experience of the language, as well as thoughts on what Go is like to a newbie

It has an Actions Panel like Sublime Text and VS Code where you can work with files, interact with the operating system, or modify Marta itself. But for my money time, if it can remember the state of how I left things the last time… it’s far better than Finder already!

                    <span>This post reacting to other people’s reaction to GitLab’s recent free tier changes starts kinda rant-y:
Lots of users expect to get things for free, forever, from for-profit companies that don’t answer to them. Those users contribute almost nothing1 to the bottom line for the for-profit companies, and actively drive up costs for them. Yet, somehow, with no skin in the game, they feel entitled to complain and badmouth the companies because they’re not getting as much value for their monthly contribution of nothing at all.
But it ends with a pretty strong call to build things for ourselves:
Create a business case, get the funding, stand up the infrastructure, and pay people to work on it rather than expecting for-profit companies to prioritize (what you see as) the public good over profit. Whether that’s how things should be or not, it is how they are and that isn’t going to change as long as the only movement in the direction of change is people hectoring for-profit companies to do better.

                    <span>When Rich Harris was last on JS Party, he wondered aloud:
“Should I learn Rust? Should we rewrite the Svelte compiler in Rust?” Maybe it’s a terrible idea, I don’t know, but I think it’s at least worth investigating.
Well, the effort we’re linking to here isn’t by Rich, but another member of the Svelte community. Their reasoning:
My main reason for doing this, is to compile Svelte without Node.js and possibly use Deno instead.
And the state of the project:
This is still a big work in progress. I’m mainly working on this for fun and learning. I came up with the name rustle by combining rust and svelte (ruslte &#x3D;&gt; rustle). The project is open to naming suggestions!

                    <span>Not every hash algorithm is appropriate in all scenarios, and in fact, very few algorithms are usable in more than a couple of situations. Even worse, using the wrong algorithm will lead in the best case scenario to performance problems, but in the worst case scenario to security issues and even financial loss. Thus, knowing which algorithm to pick for which application is crucial.
Therefore I’ll try to summarize how I approach the topic of hashing, including use-cases, recommended algorithms, and links to other articles.

                    <span>Chip Huyen:
As machine learning moves towards real-time, streaming technology is becoming increasingly important for data scientists. Like many people coming from a machine learning background, I used to dread streaming. In our recent survey, almost half of the data scientists we asked said they would like to move from batch prediction to online prediction but can’t because streaming is hard, both technically and operationally…
Over the last year, working with a co-founder who’s super deep into streaming, I’ve learned that streaming can be quite intuitive. This post is an attempt to rephrase what I’ve learned.

                    <span>Mahdi Yusuf is back with another set of Architecture Notes, this time covering everyone’s favorite “data structure server”, Redis:
Rather than iterating over, sorting, and ordering rows, what if the data was in data structures you wanted from the ground up? Early on, it was used much like Memcached, but as Redis improved, it became viable for many other use cases, including publish-subscribe mechanisms, streaming, and queues.

We added some features that we would’ve liked in Action Mailer, like a mobile toggle (with hotkeys), and the ability to send a test email from the browser while developing. We went all in on MJML so that we (almost) never have to think about email clients or nested tables :)
Plays well with the popular JS web frameworks, too. Demo video here.

                    <span>Mike Melanson gives props to the language many of us (myself included) enjoy lampooning:
While Java may have hit some hiccups earlier in its life, nowadays the language and its greater ecosystem have picked up the pace to meet the needs of the future in a variety of ways. In fact, it never really went anywhere: Companies like Amazon, Google, Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify, Square, and Zoom all employ Java across their vast codebases. Not to mention much of the high-scale data infrastructure over the past decade has been powered by Java, with the language serving as the backbone for the likes of Apache Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark.
You’ll have to read the article to see how he backs up statements like this one:
After nearly 30 years of Java, you might expect the language to be showing some signs of wear and tear, but nothing could be further from the truth. Java in 2022 is not a language in decline, but rather a language preparing for the effervescent future of software development.

The Linux kernel is a key component for the security of the Internet. Google uses Linux in almost everything, from the computers our employees use, to the products people around the world use daily like Chromebooks, Android on phones, cars, and TVs, and workloads on Google Cloud. Because of this, we have heavily invested in Linux’s security - and today, we’re announcing how we’re building on those investments and increasing our rewards.

In 2020, we launched an open-source Kubernetes-based Capture-the-Flag (CTF) project called, kCTF. The kCTF Vulnerability Rewar…</span>

                    <span>AlphaFold is an AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts a protein’s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence. It regularly achieves accuracy competitive with experiment, and is accelerating research in nearly every field of biology.  Daniel and Chris delve into protein folding, and explore the implications of this revolutionary and hugely impactful application of AI.

The purpose of MiniRust is to describe the semantics of an interesting fragment of Rust in a way that is both precise and understandable to as many people as possible… Specifically, MiniRust is specified by a reference interpreter that describes the step-by-step process of executing a MiniRust program, including checking at each step whether the program has Undefined Behavior.

                    <span>Daily stand-ups are a classic example of learned helplessness. We all know they’re useless, but we tell ourselves “that’s just how things are” and do nothing about it.
Lucas provides a set of five symptoms that indicate you’re doing stand-ups wrong and says if your team hits at least three of the five, your stand-ups are useless.
But, instead of just telling you to stop doing them (like I probably would), he provides a bunch of solid advice on how to make them useful again.

                    <span>The story of Kells is an inspiring one, to say the least!
I started this game back in 2020 as a fun little side-project to pass the time during the pandemic with lots of help from my son. Back then we didn’t even expect it to be playable, never mind it turning into a real game with 100+ levels and being released on Steam/PC. But even after that milestone, I never dreamed my son and I would be able to play it together around the TV on our favourite console!

                    <span>Clojure is often lauded, but you don’t see too many teams actually using it to build production systems. “Why Clojure?” is what the Penpot team gets asked the most, so they lay their reasoning out in this article. The TLDR:
Though it is not a mainstream language, Clojure was the right language for Penpot to choose because of its key features: stability, backwards compatibility, and syntactic abstraction.

 There are various threats a user faces when browsing the web. Users may be tricked into sharing sensitive information like their passwords with a misleading or fake website, also called phishing. They may also be led into installing malicious software on their machines, called malware, which can collect personal data and also hold it for ransom. Google Chrome, henceforth called Chrome, enables its users to protect themselves from such threats on the internet. When Chrome users browse the web with Safe Browsing protections, Chrome uses the Safe Browsing service from Google to identify and ward off various threats. 
Safe Browsing works in different ways depending on the user&#x27;s preferences. In the most common case, Chrome uses the privacy…</span>

                    <span>Episode 500!!! And it has been a journey! Nearly 13 years ago we started this podcast and as of today (this episode) we’ve officially shipped our 500th episode. As a companion to this episode, Jerod and Adam shipped a special Backstage episode where they reflect on 500 episodes. And…not only has it been a journey for us, but it’s also been a journey for our good friend Chris Coyier and CSS-Tricks — which he grew from his personal blog to a massively popular contributor driven model, complete with an editor-in-chief, a wide array of influential contributors, and advertisers to help fund the way. The news, of course, is that CSS-Tricks was recently acquired by DigitalOcean in March of 2022. We get into all the details of this deal, his journey, and the legacy of CSS-Tricks.

We’re doing this one different. You don’t hit a round number like this very often. So, here it is. A standalone Backstage episode. Thanks for listening and here’s to the next 500! 🥂

Overall, we had a ton of fun building this feature. It allowed us to delve into an often unexplored area of the Kubernetes API, which I am honestly happy that we got to explore. This project also took an unexpected turn in its use of tmux and exposed us to a genuinely mind-blowing project in xtermjs (I’m shocked the community had the patience to write a full shell in javascript!).

                    <span>Our today’s guest spent 4 days building a feature for his side project so that we could ship it together on Ship It!, while recording. The feature is called rave mode, and the context is Bass, an interpreted functional scripting language written in Go, riffing on the ideas of Kernel &amp; Clojure. When the local build runs, you can now press r to synchronise the beats of your currently playing Spotify track with the build output. For a demo, see bass v0.9.0 release.
Please welcome Alex Suraci, a.k.a. vito, the creator of Concourse CI and Bass.
This episode is dedicated to the late John Shutt, the creator of Kernel.
Your ideas continue in Bass.
Thank you for getting them out into the world.

Once you get it all set up, you can point VS Code’s Copilot plugin at it!

                    <span>Suraj Pillai, singing fzf’s praises:
I’m a CLI junkie, addicted to Vim motions, and never miss an opportunity to bring those two in to any part of my workflow. Naturally, I love to geek out about command line utilities and am always on the lookout for the next tool that can improve my productivity or just make CLI more fun to use. I can confidently say that Fzf is one of the handful of tools I’ve discovered over the years that has done both and has,thus, significantly improved the quality of my command line life.
