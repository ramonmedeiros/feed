                    <span>Nabeel Sulieman, Senior Software Engineer at Vercel, talks about KCert, a simpler alternative to cert-manager that he built. Gerhard tried it out, and he thinks that Nabeel is onto something. If you want to see the video that they recorded, ping us on Twitter or Slack.
We love this story, especially the long-term approach of working on something that one truly believes in, and the only reason is because it’s fun. The world needs more people like Nabeel, and we hope that this episode inspires you to go all out, and do just that.

                    <span>So what?
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out” time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
In addition to the author’s suggested solution to this problem allow me to add: developer retention! Nobody has more to figure out in a system than the people who just joined the team. Cut down on that (via better compensation, workplace satisfaction, etc.) and you cut way down on that oh so expensive “figuring out” time.

                    <span>Fine-grained authorization in microservices is hard. Definitely not impossible, but hard. You would expect that a more standardized, all-around, full-proof solution is out there, but I am afraid there isn’t. It’s a complex matter and depending on what you are building, implementation varies.
You will probably start with a boolean admin flag in your User model and then you will replace it with a role field, as we all did. However, as things progress and the business model becomes more and more complex, so do the solutions that we need to implement in order to deal with that complexity.
But how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment? In the following post I hope to help you get there.

                    <span>Today we have a special treat. A conversation with Brian Kernighan! Brian’s been in the software game since the beginning of Unix. Yes, he was there at Bell Labs when it all began. And he is still at it today, writing books and teaching the next generation at Princeton.
This is an epic and wide ranging conversation. You’ll hear about the birth of Unix, Ken Thompson’s unique skillset, why Brian thinks C has stood the test of time, his thoughts on modern languages like Go and Rust, what’s changed in 50 years of software, what makes platforms like Unix and the web so powerful, his take as a professor on the trend of programmers skipping the university track, and so much more.
Seriously, this is a must-listen.

                    <span>Lars Wikman reacts to Gerhard’s excellent conversation with Kelsey Hightower on Ship It!
So he essentially said, I’m interpreting here, that when it comes to deploying software to servers the documented manual steps for deploying something need to be the canonical reference. Then whether you build bash scripts, Ansible playbooks, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, Terraform, Kubernetes or something else to encode that procedure into something repeatable and scalable that’s a separate step. Having documented the process required to set it up means that there is an answer to the question: How do I get this running? An answer that doesn’t require you to parse the .yml files or grok Ansible roles and groups.
Lars springs forward from there with many thoughts of his own on the matter.

                    <span>At Google, Marian Croak’s technical research team, The Center for Responsible AI and Human-Centered Technology, and Jen Gennai’s operations and governance team, Responsible Innovation, collaborate often on creating a fairer future for AI systems.
The teams complement each other to support computer scientists, UX researchers and designers, product managers and subject matter experts in the social sciences, human rights and civil rights. Collectively, their teams include more than 200 people around the globe focused on putting our AI Principles – Google’s ethical charter – into practice.
“The intersection of AI systems and society is a critical area of my team’s technical research,” Marian says. “Our approach includes working directly with people who use and are impacted by AI systems. Worki…</span>

                    <span>Carrie Cai, Ben Zevenbergen and Johnny Soraker all work on developing artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly at Google, in the larger research community and across the technology industry. Carrie is a research scientist focusing on human-AI interaction, Ben is an ethicist and policy advisor and Johnny is an AI Principles ethicist. They all work within a global team of experts from a variety of fields, including the social sciences and humanities, focused on the ethical development of AI. They’re driven to make systems that are fair, inclusive and focused on people.
But they have more than their work in common: They’re all accomplished musicians who’ve studied music, composed and published pieces and even played at the professional level. We wanted to know more about their musical backgro…</span>

                    <span>It’s not hard to find articles or pieces of research claiming that the sooner you find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix. But I’ve found there isn’t actually a whole lot of information out there on exactly how to prevent bugs in the early stages of a software development project. i.e. before code is written, while requirements/user stories are being written or just after the requirements/user stories have been written.
Here I would like to share exactly how I help prevent bugs on projects and how I help others come up with ideas on how to prevent bugs as well.

                    <span>There is a general belief that legacy systems, stale code, and archaic tooling are sleeping dogs – we avoid them fearing a collapse from interference or deprioritize them for seemingly more important projects. I think this strategy of intentional avoidance and/or deprioritization is perfect for disasters.
The challenge with systems that do not fail is that they have no fixes when they eventually fail. Thus, it is more urgent to fix these systems than is usually accepted.

                    <span>A short, cogent argument why hosting your own cloud services is worth the time/effort:
Consider this, you carefully curate your playlists on Spotify but every now and then you see a certain song missing from your playlist. Same goes for videos saved in your YouTube playlists or other music/video streaming services. Then there is also the case of OTT streaming platforms where the show you were going to watch over weekend has now disappeared.
The author points to r/selfhosted and this awesome self hosted list as good resources to get started.

                    <span>The tree UI is ubiquitous in software applications. There are many tree component libraries for React, but none were full-featured enough to stand on their own.
This library provides all the common features expected in a tree. You can select one or many nodes to drag and drop into new positions, open and close folders, render an inline form for renaming, efficiently show thousands of items, and provide your own node renderer to control the style.

                    <span>Where by “auditing” they mean change tracking, not security testing:
Auditing is particularly useful for historical analysis. To demonstrate, imagine you have a users table that tracks when a user is online. You might add a status column which can have one of two values: online and offline. How would you track how long a user is online for throughout an entire month? An auditing system would track every change with timestamps, and so you can measure the difference between each timestamp and sum them up for the entire month.
What really impresses me about the Supabase team is how much they’re leaning in to Postgres’ rich feature set to build high-quality-yet-low-level abstractions for their users. Paul Copplestone emphasized this when we had him on the show back in January.

                    <span>This week we’re bringing The Changelog to Go Time — we had an awesome conversation with Toby Padilla, Co-Founder at Charm where they’re building tools to make the command line glamorous. Toby and the team at Charm have gone “all in” on Go — all of Charm is written in Go. They moved to Go from other languages, saying “Go is the answer to building these type of tools.” And even on this episode Toby says “I love Rust, it’s really cool, it’s a super-exciting language, but I jumped ship. I wanna be more productive, I wanna use all the fun toys, and so I started doing Go.” Clearly this episode will be in good company here on Go Time.
We talk about the state of the art, the next big thing happening on the command line and in ssh-land. They have an array of open source tooling to build great apps …</span>

                    <span>Max Howell, creator of Homebrew, has gone back to his notes on brew2 to apply web3 concepts to help “distribute value to open source.” He’s calling this new brew tea.
Tools like Homebrew lie beneath all development tools, assisting developers to actually get development done. We know the graph of all open source, which means we’re uniquely placed to innovate in interesting and exciting ways. This is exactly what tea will do. We’re taking our knowledge of how to make development more efficient and throwing innovations nobody has ever really considered before.
With plans to move the package registry on-chain, Max lays out the numerous benefits due to “inherent benefits of blockchain technology”:
Packages will be immutable (no more left-pad incidents)
Packages will always be available (we’ll use decentralized storage)
Releases will be signed by the maintainers themselves (rather than a middleman you are told you can trust)
Tools can be built to fundamentally verify the integrity of your app’s open source constitution
Token can flow through the graph
Max says “token flowing is where things get really interesting,” and goes on to say “with our system people who care about the health of the open source ecosystem buy some token and stake it.”

                    <span>From Jon Maddox on The GitHub blog (from waaay back in the day):
At GitHub, we have normalized on a set of script names for all of our projects that individual contributors will be familiar with the second after they clone a project. We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.
Here’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:
script/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies
script/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time
script/update – updates a project to run at its current version
script/server – starts app
script/test – runs tests
script/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests
script/console – opens a console
Each of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.
Note: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.

                    <span>ZFS has become very portable in recent years of its development, supporting six (6) operating systems: FreeBSD, Illumos, Linux, MacOS, NetBSD, and Windows. But what if you wanted to create a ZPool compatible with all of them? Which options and ZFS features should you choose?
If you haven’t yet, check out The Changelog #475 where I talk with Matt Ahrens (co-founder of the ZFS project) about making the ZFS file system.

                    <span>Over the years, teams across Google have focused on how technology — specifically artificial intelligence and hardware innovations — can improve access to high-quality, equitable healthcare across the globe.
Accessing the right healthcare can be challenging depending on where people live and whether local caregivers have specialized equipment or training for tasks like disease screening. To help, Google Health has expanded its research and applications to focus on improving the care clinicians provide and allow care to happen outside hospitals and doctor’s offices.
Today, at our Google Health event The Check Up, we’re sharing new areas of AI-related research and development and how we’re providing clinicians with easy-to-use tools to help them better care for patients. Here’s a look at som…</span>

                    <span>Pia Wiedermayer, Lead QA at Zühlke, is talking with Gerhard today about software quality. If the name sounds familiar, check out episode 28. Thank you Romano for the introduction 👋🏻
Do you remember the last time that you used an app, whether it was in the browser or on your mobile, and everything just worked? What about that intuitive feel, snappiness and you achieving the task that you intended to without feeling that you are fighting tech? Experiences like those take a lot of effort across multiple disciplines. They are designed, built and maintained over long periods of time. It all starts with people like Pia that really care about quality. It’s so much more than just automated testing…

                    <span>The term “foundation” model has been around since about the middle of last year when a research group at Stanford published the comprehensive report On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models. The naming of these models created some strong reactions, both good and bad. In this episode, Chris and Daniel dive into the ideas behind the report.

!important was added for one reason only: laws in the US that require certain text to be in a given font-size. !important stops the cascade from changing it.
Anything else is probably misuse, and a sign you may not understand the cascade properly.

Hamilton remembered being the only woman in her college physics class — “And at the time, I think the professor thought women should not be taking physics because he  … well, you have to know the times.”
She added, “That was the only time somebody in college questioned that that might not be something I would be able to make use of.”
But Hamilton remained undeterred: “I just said, ‘Because I want to take it,’ you know.”

But just like that time you whacked a zombie over the head with a shovel only to discover it was really your friend Jimmy with a hangover, this would be a grave mistake. And I use the term ‘grave’ advisedly, because having sent Jimmy to an early grave, this would increase the likelihood of him becoming a zombie in the not too distant future.

This article speaks my language, but does so to a corner of the software world that I don’t visit too often: Windows
Windows is a critical element in this system because it is hard to find good productivity software that runs on Windows, especially if you want to run it outside of a web browser. Windows, in my opinion, is far behind Mac OS X, iOS, and Android, in having thoughtfully designed and efficient software—both in general, and in particular for writing, organization, and task management

                    <span>It was a while since I last spoke Swedish on a podcast. I joined the friendly hosts Sebastian and Alex of the Trevlig Mjukvara (translates to something like “Nice Software”) podcast and we talked software development, open source, curl, Mozilla and a few other topics for an hour. I had a great time. (We had … Continue reading Trevlig Mjukvara →</span>

                    <span>A falsehood is an idea that you initially believe was true, but in-reality it is proven to be false.
E.g. of an idea: valid email address exactly has one @ character. So, you will use this rule to implement your email-field validation logic. Right? Wrong! The reality is: emails can have multiple @ chars. Therefore your implementation should allow this. The initial idea is a falsehood you believed in.
I love this list with my whole heart. We need to do a show on this…

                    <span>One of the most interesting parts of working at Google is learning what other people do here — it’s not uncommon to come across a job title you’ve never heard of. For example: ProFair Program Manager, or ProFair Analyst.
These roles are part of our Responsible Innovation team, which focuses on making sure our tech supports Google’s AI Principles. One way the team does this is by conducting proactive algorithmic product fairness — or ProFair — testing. This means bringing social and cultural perspectives to the testing process, to assess how an AI or ML application, dataset or technique might avoid reinforcing unfair bias. Three women who work on ProFair testing are Anne Peckham, N’Mah Y. and Cherish M. and today we’re asking them: What’s your job?

On any moderately-sized Node.js project you’ve likely already outgrown the package.json “scripts” section. But because the growth was gradual, with no single acute pain point, you might not have noticed. There’s a better way.
I’ve never been able to get into Makefiles, but many people I respect love them. For me the syntax is too arcane, but I recognize the power. If the “scripts” section of your package.json is getting unwieldy, it might be time for a make over. (yes I went there)

                    <span>I’ve avoided using Docker Desktop on my Mac like you avoid those 16-seeds in your March Madness bracket. Why? Because it’s dog slow. But not anymore?
The 4.6 release of Docker Desktop for Mac contains a number of changes that drastically improve file sharing performance for macOS users. Firstly, developers now have the option of using a new experimental file sharing implementation called virtiofs (the current default is gRPC-FUSE). Secondly, improvements have been made to the way that files are synced between the macOS host and Docker VM. During testing with our amazing macOS community of users, we have observed that these changes have reduced the time taken to complete filesystem operations by up to 98%.
virtiofs is an experimental feature, so you need to enable it to realize these gains.

                    <span>This piece by Aria Beingessner is incredibly relevant to our shipping-this-week episode with Brian Kernighen:
My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.
C is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.
And just in case these pull quotes leave you with the impression that Aria is happy about the situation… yeah, nope.

                    <span>For both MDN and Open Web Docs (OWD), transparency is paramount to our missions. With the upcoming launch of MDN Plus, we believe it’s a good time to talk about how our two organizations work together, and if there is a financial relationship between us. Here is an overview of how our missions overlap and how they differ, and how a premium subscription service fits all this.
The post Mozilla and Open Web Docs working together on MDN appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

                    <span>From predicting floods to improving waste management, organizations and researchers across Asia Pacific are using technology to respond to the impact of climate change.
Supporting this important work is a priority for Google.org. At today’s Southeast Asia Development Symposium, we announced a $6 million Sustainability Seed Fund to help organizations dedicated to addressing some of the region’s most difficult sustainability challenges. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks, including how nonprofits can apply.
The new fund builds on the support Google.org has already provided — through grants, technology and Googlers’ time — for sustainability-focused organizations and researchers across Asia-Pacific over recent years. I recently had the chance to talk to one of those existing …</span>

In their moment, minicomputers were used in a variety of applications. They served as communications controllers, instrument controllers, large system pre-processors, desk calculators, and real-time data acquisition handlers. But they also laid the foundation for significant hardware architecture advances and contributed greatly to modern operating systems, programming languages, and interactive computing as we know them today.
We were just discussing this machine on our upcoming episode with Brian Kernighan.

                    <span>HUBFS is a file system for GitHub and Git. Git repositories and their contents are represented as regular directories and files and are accessible by any application, without the application having any knowledge that it is really accessing a remote Git repository. The repositories are writable and allow editing files and running build operations.
So if you hubfs mnt (on macOS/Linux), it will set up a file hierarchy inside /mnt that follows this pattern: / owner / repository / ref / path. Cool idea! It is affected by GitHub’s API rate limiting and I’m not sure if/how it syncs (commits) back to the remote repos…

                    <span>Schema changes are usually critical operations to perform on a high volume database. One thing off, and you are looking at an outage. pg-osc makes it easy and safe to run any ALTER statement on a production database table with no locking.

                    <span>Here’s one of the 15 language-agnostic, actionable tips on REST API design:
Use conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Don’t use too many, and use the same status codes for the same outcomes across the API.
Smile Egbai had a solid rant about this on Go Time recently.

                    <span>Julia Evans lays out her process for taking API responses in her browser’s dev tools and using them in her own programs/scripts:
look in developer tools for a promising JSON response
copy as cURL
remove irrelevant headers
translate it into Python
Some of you might be wondering – can you always do this?
The answer is sort of yes – browsers aren’t magic! All the information browsers send to your backend is just HTTP requests. So if I copy all of the HTTP headers that my browser is sending, I think there’s literally no way for the backend to tell that the request isn’t sent by my browser and is actually being sent by a random Python program.

                    <span>This proposal is brand new (stage 0), but I hear that a lot of work has been put into it behind the scenes by a lot of people, so it has that going for it…
This proposal aims to enable developers to add type annotations to their JavaScript code, allowing those annotations to be checked by a type checker that is external to JavaScript. At runtime, a JavaScript engine ignores them, treating the types as comments.
The aim of this proposal is to enable developers to run programs written in TypeScript, Flow, and other static typing supersets of JavaScript without any need for transpilation, if they stick within a certain reasonably large subset of the language.
The implications of this change are pretty massive, if it were to ever ship. And you better believe we’re putting together a JS Party episode to discuss it with the people involved.

                    <span>Gary Marcus makes the case that deep learning has hit a wall:
Let me start by saying a few things that seem obvious,” Geoffrey Hinton, “Godfather” of deep learning, and one of the most celebrated scientists of our time, told a leading AI conference in Toronto in 2016. “If you work as a radiologist you’re like the coyote that’s already over the edge of the cliff but hasn’t looked down.” Deep learning is so well-suited to reading images from MRIs and CT scans, he reasoned, that people should “stop training radiologists now” and that it’s “just completely obvious within five years deep learning is going to do better.”
Fast forward to 2022, and not a single radiologist has been replaced.
But he doesn’t stop there. After laying out multiple examples of deep learning failures, he change tone:
For the first time in 40 years, I finally feel some optimism about AI.

                    <span>Posted by Adrian Taylor, Chrome Security Team
If you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like &#x27;exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild&#x27; have been appearing more often recently. In this post we&#x27;ll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We&#x27;ll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. 
How things work today 
While the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it&#x27;s because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it&#x27;s actually a good thing! I…</span>

                    <span>In this week’s episode Cameron Dutro, a software engineer at GitHub, Ship It listener and someone with an extraordinary attention to detail, joins us to talk about Kuby, a convention-over-configuration approach to deploying Rails apps.
The question that we will be trying to answer is what happened to Rails Active Deployment. The path to that promise land is paved with good intentions, but it’s complicated.

Should you move to serverless? Is GraphQL the answer to your API woes? Should you follow the latest DevOps playbook to increase your system reliability? In the world of tech tools, there’s a lot of buzz. But it doesn’t always reflect the daily reality of programmers.
As the founder of a developer tools startup, I’ve talked with hundreds, if not thousands, of software developers over the last few years in the course of routine user research. The common theme in these conversations, even bigger than the need for the product we were building, was an overarching need that is currently underserved: building for real developers, or what I like to call the 99% Developers.
Good stuff to be reminded of. That reminds me: You are not Google/Amazon/LinkedIn.

                    <span>Rich Burroughs:
When you hear the phrase “cloud native,” is Kubernetes the first thing that comes to your mind? It is for me, and I expect I’m not alone. Kubernetes is now the second-largest open source project after Linux, and it’s the big fish in the cloud native pond. But there are many other projects in the CNCF landscape and the broader cloud native community.
So, I thought I’d list some cloud native tools that can be very useful for teams that aren’t using Kubernetes or aren’t using it for every workload. Here are 7 of them that I like a lot.
If Rich’s name rings a bell, that’s because he was just on Ship It! last week. 😉

                    <span>It’s possible to pair well simply by avoiding pairing poorly.
I’ve never thought about it that way, but yeah, makes sense. What follows is a list of things not to do when pairing. Things for navigators, things for drivers, and things for both.
This is just one page from Tuple’s pair programming guide, which looks excellent all-around.

This project have started as an experiment to discover generics implementation. It may look like Lodash in some aspects. I used to code with the awesome go-funk package, but it uses reflection and therefore is not typesafe.
As expected, benchmarks demonstrate that generics will be much faster than implementations based on reflect stdlib package. Benchmarks also shows similar performances to pure for loops.

                    <span>This week we have the pleasure of Rich Burroughs, Senior Developer Advocate at Loft Labs and host of the Kube Cuddle podcast.
We talk about multitenancy in Kubernetes and how to run Kubernetes in Kubernetes with vcluster. If you are using KiND, you will find this episode interesting, and maybe even helpful.
We also talk about the role that Kelsey Hightower played in Rich joining the CNCF ecosystem. The key take-away is that people make all the difference.
ADHD is something that Rich thinks about often. Gerhard was curious about the difference between ADHD and burnout, as well as this Twitter thread on re-reading sent emails.

                    <span>Bhupesh Varshney:
A lot of folks looking how to get started on open source are given very generic advice on how to approach their first contribution. In this newsletter issue I share one specific actionable item.
His secret tip? Solve static analyzer issues. There, I saved you a click. Unless you’re not sure what he means by that or want his advice on how to actually get that done…

                    <span>So Argc is a little Rust program that your bash scripts can use to make handling command-line parameters easy. You describe the options, parameters, and subcommands in comments like this:
# @describe A demo cli

# @cmd Upload a file
# @arg target!                      File to upload
upload() {
    echo &quot;cmd                       upload&quot;
    echo &quot;arg:  target              $argc_target&quot;
}

Then you trust Argc to parse that and do the heavy lifting:
eval &quot;$(argc -e $0 &quot;$@&quot;)&quot;

The only drawback (aside from potential parsing bugs) to this approach is your script now depends on having argc in the machine’s executable path. i.e. – it’s not portable.
What’d be even cooler, IMHO, would be to instead use argc as a pre-processor of sorts that spits out a pure-bash implementation from your input script. Regardless, a cool idea!

                    <span>Chris Ferdinandi:
For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!
I built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I’ve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.
Heck, even Chris’s disclaimer of ‘when SPAs make sense’ section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation. But I digress… read this post it’s a good one for sure.

                    <span>Writing high quality standards is a necessary first step to an interoperable web platform, but ensuring that browsers are consistent in their behavior requires an ongoing process. Browsers must work to ensure that they have a shared understanding of web standards, and that their implementation matches that understanding.
Interop 2022 is a cross-browser initiative to find and address the most important interoperability pain points on the web platform. The end result is a public metric that will assess progress toward fixing these interoperability issues.
The post Announcing Interop 2022 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>
