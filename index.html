When I first started working on Typesense six years ago, I set myself a simple rule:
I shall write some code everyday before or after work.
That’s it. No deadlines, no quarterly goals, no milestones.
Looking back, I cannot believe how much I’ve been able to ship over the past 6 years by just following this one rule.
This rule has served me well in my career as well. Showing up consistently and putting in the work pays dividends over the long-term that you just can’t see over the short-term. …</p>

                <p>Posted by Ryan Hurst, Production Security Team

The way we design and build software is continually evolving. Just as we now think of security as something we build into software from the start, we are also increasingly looking for new ways to minimize trust in that software. One of the ways we can do that is by designing software so that you can get cryptographic certainty of what the software has done.
In this post, we'll introduce the concept of verifiable data structures that help us get this cryptograp…</p>

                <p>Go modules brought about quite a few changes to the Go ecosystem. One of those changes is semantic import versioning (SIV), which has a fairly pronounced effect on how libraries are identified. In this episode we are joined by Tim Heckman and Peter Bourgon to discuss some of the downsides to these changes and how it has lead to what a subset of the Go community refers to as the “v2+ problem.”

                <p>In any software project, over time new features and APIs are added and from time-to-time some of them also become deprecated and eventually get removed. Even huge project such as Kubernetes is no exception to this, yet core parts of its API don’t really come to mind when thinking about deprecating and eventual removal. So, the question is - could a core object or API in Kubernetes, such as Pod, Deployment or Service be removed and if so, how would that go?

While there are many resources to help programmers write better code—such as books and static analyzers—there are few for writing better comments. While it’s easy to measure the quantity of comments in a program, it’s hard to measure the quality, and the two are not necessarily correlated. A bad comment is worse than no comment at all. Here are some rules to help you achieve a happy medium.

Have you heard the story about the boy who cried wolf? Spoiler alert: the wolf eats the sheep. If we don’t want our sheep to be eaten, we need better tools.
As of today, npm audit is a stain on the entire npm ecosystem. The best time to fix it was before rolling it out as a default. The next best time to fix it is now.

While the startup cities industry is still small, it is already quite heterogeneous. Each project has its own distinct set of goals, motivations, and scope. However, this diversity isn’t fully captured by the vocabulary we use right now.
To help myself create a mental map of the industry, I’ve grouped these motivations into 5 categories. I’ve also included examples of places that personify each motivation.

                <p>Responsive design is evolving. Una Kravets:
Today, when using the term: “responsive design”, you are most likely thinking about using media queries to change layout when resizing a design from mobile size, to tablet size, through to desktop size.
But soon, this perception of responsive design may be considered as outdated as using tables for page layout.
“Responsive” used to mean a web design would respond based on the size of the device accessing it. In the not-so-distant future, it will mean a web design …</p>

Contributors to the Scorecards project, an automated security tool that produces a “risk score” for open source projects, have accomplished a lot since our launch last fall. Today, in collaboration  with the Open Source Security Foundation community, we are announcing Scorecards v2. We have added new security checks, scaled up the number of projects being scored, and made this data easily accessible for analysis.

Well, it’s not that it’s too easy to lose your data — but rather, that it’s too difficult to recover it. For each operation you want to recover from, there’s a different “magic” incantation to undo it. All the data is still there in principle, but it’s not accessible to many in practice.

Sometimes you want to start a thing, but don’t have a good idea. Or maybe you’ve tried a few times, but nothing that generated income. Rather than start from scratch with an unproven idea, buy a thing on Tiny Acquisitions.

We are going to create, digitally sign, and broadcast a Bitcoin transaction in pure Python, from scratch, and with zero dependencies. In the process we’re going to learn quite a bit about how Bitcoin represents value. Let’s get it.

Eight years in the making with 28,000 commits, 7400 pull requests, and 4100 closed issues, Scala 3.0 has been released, delivering a “complete overhaul of the Scala language” with new features, updates to the syntax and type systems, and new tools for meta-programming.

On top of that, this package also adds bitmap indexing to the columnar storage, allowing to build filter queries using binary and, and not, or and xor (see kelindar/bitmap with SIMD support).

                <p>You sigh. Maybe the compilation didn’t work? You recompile and run it again. Nope. Still the same problem. You stare out the window.
This post is about ways of getting unstuck on a problem when you do not (yet) have all the relevant knowledge. It focuses on the problem with the ego when being a more seasoned programmer and the difficulty on admitting that you don’t know (yet).
From there we go through the steps on being unstuck and making that ego more inflated and annoying.

                <p>Super Mario World Widescreen is your beloved Mario World SNES game but in the 16:9 resolution. This is possible by expanding the horizontal resolution by 96 pixels, increasing resolution from 256x224 to 352x224. Since the original SNES does not have this resolution, the emulator focused into high definition mods bsnes-hd must be used.
I love how open source hackers give classic games like this new life by applying their skill and ingenuity to a property they love. I wonder if having it in widescreen changes…</p>

Earlier this year Open Collective announced “Funds for Open Source.” The idea is simple, make it easy for companies to invest in open source, and they will. Also, since recording this episode, Pia and the team at Open Collective along with Gitcoin announced fundoss.org as part of Maintainer Week announcements. And right now, they have a matching fund of $75,000 dollars funding open source that you can suppor…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>DenoDB has a fully-typed API (which is great for editor integration) and supports a whole host of backends: MySQL/Maria, SQLite, Postgres, and MongoDB.
Broad database support is great for library adoption, but as a user I’d prefer something that leans in to a specific ecosystem, which usually lets you squeeze more out of it.
Regardless of that, it’s great to see the Deno community building foundational tools like this.
