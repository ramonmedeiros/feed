                    <span>Rust is quite popular, but why? Emil Ernerfeldt, CTO of rerun.io, shares his thoughts in the subject.
I believe Rust is the most important development in system programming languages since C. What is novel is not any individual feature (‚ÄúRust is not a particularly original language‚Äù), but the fact that so many amazing features have come together in one mainstream language.
Rust is not a perfect language (scroll down for my complaints!), but it‚Äôs so much nicer than anything else I‚Äôve used.
I‚Äôm not alone in loving Rust - Rust has been the most loved language in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for seven years straight. So what are the features that make me love Rust so much?

This includes things like starting a webserver, opening a browser, parsing JSON files, benchmarking programs and many more, all of which we will explore in this article.

I‚Äôve been doing this ‚Äúreliability‚Äù stuff for a little while now (~5 years), at companies ranging from about 20 developers to over 2,000. I‚Äôve always cared primarily about the software elements I describe as living ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the application ‚Äì like, how does it get its configuration? What kinds of instances does it run on, and are those the best kinds to use? What steps does it take on its path from ‚Äúcode in a repository‚Äù to ‚Äúrunning in production‚Äù? And I‚Äôve always kept track of what I liked ‚Äì which mechanisms allowed fast iteration and which caused frustration, which led to outages and which prevented them.
‚Ä¶ So! With that out of the way ‚Äì this is how I‚Äôd rebuild it all from scratch if I could.

                    <span>vdsql is a new plugin that allows VisiData to connect to databases and query them directly, using the database‚Äôs own query engine.  It uses Ibis to generate SQL for many popular backends, including Postgres, DuckDB, Clickhouse, and more.
vdsql v0.2, released this past week, is already quite useful, and development continues to improve both vdsql and VisiData for bigger data!

                    <span>Smashing Mag‚Äôs Vitaly Friedman puts down some of his recent thoughts on authentication flows:
nobody wakes up in the morning hoping to finally identify crosswalks and fire hydrants that day. Yet every day, we prompt users through hoops and loops to sign up and log in, to set a complex enough password or recover one, to find a way to restore access to locked accounts and logged-out sessions.
Of course security matters, yet too often, it gets in the way of usability. As Jared Spool said once, ‚ÄúIf a product isn‚Äôt usable, it‚Äôs also not secure.‚Äù That‚Äôs when people start using private email accounts and put passwords on stick-it-notes because they forget them. As usual, Jared hits the nail on the head here. So what can we do to improve the authentication UX?
Vitaly lists seven recommendations. Nothing radical here, but solid advice worth thinking through.

                    <span>Andr√© Staltz:
I used to believe there was mass collaboration on the internet. But I‚Äôve realized that collaboration is extremely hard. It does not scale, especially not at internet scale. The examples we look up to are either not collaborative on the microscopic level, or are rare exceptions to the rule.
The examples he‚Äôs referring to are ‚ÄúWikipedia, open source projects such as Linux, hacktivism, and crowdsourced science experiments such as Rosetta@home.‚Äù
This post is sobering, but Andr√© speaks from a lot of experience.

We are excited to announce passkey support on Android and Chrome for developers to test today, with general availability following later this year. In this post we cover details on how passkeys stored in the Google Password Manager are kept secure. See our post on the Android Developers Blog for a more general overview.
Passkeys are a safer and more secure alternative to passwords. They also replace the need for traditional 2nd factor authentication methods such as text message, app based one-time codes or push-based approvals. Passkeys use public-key cryptography so that data breaches of service providers don&#x27;t result in a compromise of passkey-protected accounts, and are based on industry standard APIs and protocols to ensure they are not su‚Ä¶</span>

In a country where only about 24% of the population has a power supply to their home from the national grid, the rate in Lamwo is even lower. This is partly due to lack of information: The government doesn‚Äôt have precise data about where settlements are located, what types of buildings there are, and what the buildings‚Äô electricity needs might be. And canvassing the area isn‚Äôt practical, because the roads require four-wheel-drive vehicles and are impassable in the rain.

                    <span>A journey from Stripe to Paypal and back to Stripe led Zed Shaw to the conclusion in the headline. And, no, that is not a compliment (in case you weren‚Äôt sure).
Zed goes deep on why he feels this way, listing seven serious downsides to using Stripe today. What‚Äôs a dev to do? His advice at the end alone is worth the cost of admission:
This is why I advocate to people to be ready to switch payment processing at a moment‚Äôs notice. Right now I could flip two options and I‚Äôd be back on Paypal. If I was pressed I could probably implement any other payment processor in about a week or a day. The ability to quickly switch payments is your only defense against frozen accounts, fraud, and rogue employees.

This improvement was achieved via a small change in how locking is implemented within Firefox&#x27;s memory allocator.

                    <span>After more than half a decade (6+ years), Mastodon.technology is shutting down. The reason? One person is responsible (Ash Furrow) and they‚Äôve hit their limit personally and technically.
A member of my family was very recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. I am doing everything I can to support them.
Last week, with yet more Elon Musk and Twitter news, the fediverse generally experienced extra traffic with an influx of new users. I woke up to mastodon.technology downtime alerts. In the midst of supporting my family, I had to ssh into a server and fiddle with settings.
I am exhausted.
The server has also gotten too large and too complex for me to administer. I‚Äôve always been keen to learn the next new skill I need to be an effective admin. But I just don‚Äôt have it in me anymore. The monitoring that I have in place is insufficient to solve the current problems and I have zero bandwidth to invest in learning the skills to diagnose and fix the issue.
Ages ago (4 years) we talked with Eugen Rochko on The Changelog (the creator of Mastodon) about the ‚Äúabsolute freedom in how people can run their servers,‚Äù  and how the ‚Äúincentives are usually ideological‚Äù when running a Mastodon server.
Yes, we talked about the costs of running a server, but from my recollection that seemed to be purely from a monetary perspective. The costs of running a server are also quite time intensive and those costs needs to be factored in as well.

                    <span>This is a solid primer on git rebase and the many ways it‚Äôs useful.
In Git, a rebase is a very versatile and useful tool to rework commits. Use it to achieve a workflow with high-quality changes proposed in high-quality commits and merge requests. It makes your developers and reviewers more efficient. Code reviews and debugging also become easier and more effective.

                    <span>This working implementation of text-to-3D (powered by Stable Diffusion) didn‚Äôt take six months, like Simon predicted it would. Although I will concede that it‚Äôs not a 3D environment that can then go into in a game engine, but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs just a few more weeks away this point.
From the readme:
This project is a work-in-progress, and contains lots of differences from the paper. Also, many features are still not implemented now. The current generation quality cannot match the results from the original paper, and many prompts still fail badly!

Lemon infrastructure runs digital wallets &amp; physical cards, which technically makes them a bank. How does Matias &amp; his team think about enabling developers get code from their workstations into production? Remember, we are talking about a bank - a bad deploy is a big deal. And when a bad database migration goes out, what happens then?

                    <span>When we had Mike Riley on the show back in May, one major deterrent to his pitch that we can/should ‚Äúrun our homes on a Raspberry Pi‚Äù is that, well, you couldn‚Äôt buy one anywhere.
It‚Äôs six months later and you still can‚Äôt buy one! In this post, Jeff Geerling dives into the why behind that unfortunate fact, gets an official response from RPi, and lays out a few alternatives. One alternative even pleasantly surprised him‚Ä¶

The goal of this list of facts is not to teach you what state machines are or how to use them; there are plenty of other resources for that. Rather, the goal here is to motivate their usage and to highlight things about them that are frequently overlooked, but nonetheless relevant.

We talk about what ID3 is, its many versions, what it aims to be and what it could have been, how our library project got started, all the unique features and failed dreams of the ID3v2 spec, how ID3v2 and Podcast 2.0 are solving the problem differently, and how all of this maps back to us giving you (our listeners) a better experience while listening to our shows.

                    <span>Jean Yang:
There‚Äôs clearly a lot of programmer pain. But why we don‚Äôt see more tech transfer of these ‚Äúdeep‚Äù technologies from research into industry is something I have been thinking about since I was in college, when I decided I wanted to spend my life making programmers‚Äô lives better. Many other fields, from robotics to databases, have clearer paths to commercialization. But when it comes to new programming languages or software analyses, the path of tech transfer is often decades-long, if it exists at all.
She goes on to describe a few factors that are in the way of ‚Äúdeep tech‚Äù dev tools investing, how some of those things are changing, and how others still need to change.

                    <span>Dracula UI is a dark-first collection of UI patterns and components. Key features:
Built for Dark Mode:  Most templates are built using light colors and later on adapted to dark colors. Dark themes shouldn‚Äôt be an afterthought, they should be a top priority.
Designer Friendly: Speed up the prototyping phase by using a highly configurable Design System. Collaborate easily by taking advantage of a carefully crafted Figma file.
Great Developer Experience: Don‚Äôt worry about class names, just use the Visual Studio Code snippets. You can take advantage of autocomplete and also access the entire documentation right from your code editor.

Chapters are neat, they let you see a Table of Contents, jump to specific parts and similar. The changelog.com site is an open source project built in Elixir. I love working with Elixir. It is a steadily growing but still somewhat niche language and it doesn‚Äôt have every library under the sun, only most of them. It hasn‚Äôt had a fully fledged ID3v2 library so far. There are a few libraries that let you parse a tag in one specific way, targeting a subset. I haven‚Äôt found any that allow writing a tag.

                    <span>One of our listeners, Andrew Welker, suggested that we talk about Klustered, so a few hours before David Flanagan was about to do his workshop at Container Days, we recorded this episode. We talked about all the weird and wonderful Kubernetes debugging sessions on Klustered, a YouTube playlist with 43 videos and counting.
We then talked about Rawkode Academy, and we finished with conferences. Good thing we did, because David almost forgot about KubeHuddle, the conference that he is co-organising next week. Gerhard is looking forward to talking at it! No, seriously, check it out at kubehuddle.com.

The MNT Pocket Reform has a seven-inch screen with a clamshell design that, when closed, will be less than five centimeters thick. If its perky purple facade looks a bit retro, that‚Äôs no surprise; the Pocket‚Äôs inspirations read like a ‚Äògreatest hits‚Äô list of pocketable computers.
They‚Äôre taking open source seriously:
MNT‚Äôs open-source promise is not limited to an open source operating system or select internal components The Pocket Reform, as with MNT‚Äôs full-size Reform laptop, will provide mainboard schematics, 3D models for physical components, and open source drivers, among other things.
Coming soon to a crowd fund near you.

                    <span>I love that people are bringing HTML back to the forefront:
Our mission is to enable anyone to build multi-page dynamic web apps while staying as close to the platform as possible. Enhance fills in the gaps to make building for the backend, and the browser a seamless experience for web authors and consumers.
Modern JavaScript frameworks bring more problems than they solve; recreating native web platform features adding unnecessary weight and complexity, which is challenging to unravel.
Enhance provides a dependable foundation built on standards-based web platform features, allowing developers to create web applications that are lightweight, flexible, and future-proof.

It‚Äôs another thing to integrate data labeling into your workflows and infrastructure in a scalable, secure, and useful way. Mark from Xelex joins us to talk through some of what he has learned after helping companies scale their data annotation efforts. We get into workflow management, labeling instructions, team dynamics, and quality assessment. This is a super practical episode!

                    <span>Vivian Qu states her case as to why Apple‚Äôs decision to remove outdated apps from the App Store is dumb, especially for indies like her.
Never mind the fact that my app has a 5-star rating and was still being downloaded, with no complaints from any of my users. Also disregard the fact that I had other highly-rated apps up on the App Store, some of which had been updated much more recently than July 2019, clearly showing that I have not abandoned these apps entirely. If there had been an actual reviewer who checked my outdated app, they would have discovered that I architected the app from the beginning to dynamically scale the UI so it resizes to fit the latest iPhone devices. All these could be signals that indicate to Apple that this is not a garbage-filled scam app that is lowering the quality of their App Store.
She goes on to tell the entire saga that she (and others) were put through to keep their apps on the store. Sometimes an app isn‚Äôt outdated, it‚Äôs just complete. Ya know?

It‚Äôs built right on top of the upcoming graphics API WebGPU, but falls back to the functional WebGL wrapper, REGL; its previous Three.js version is maintained in a separate branch.
I used to spend countless hours in college scouring the web for the best digital rain screen saver for my laptop. Sounds like the author is with me on that:
The number of implementations out there of this effect is a testament to the size of the film‚Äôs impact on popular culture. For decades, I‚Äôve enjoyed searching for and comparing them from time to time. That‚Äôs probably how you arrived here‚Äî it‚Äôs fun to see what kinds of solutions different people come up with to a problem, when the process is purely recreational and its success is subjective.
This one‚Äôs really nice and even has a 3D mode. The README says it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade with love‚Äù, but from what I can tell it‚Äôs almost entirely JavaScript. üòú

The last time we had Lucas on the show he was living the text-mode only life, and now we‚Äôre more than 3 years later, Lucas has doubled down on all things text mode. Today‚Äôs conversation with Lucas maps several ideas he‚Äôs shared recently on his blog. We talk about deadlines being pointless, trajectory vs roadmap and the downfall of long-term planning, the practices of daily stand-ups and what to do instead, measuring queues not cycle time, and probably the most controversial of them all ‚Äî actually talking to your customers. Have you heard? It‚Äôs this newly disruptive Agile framework that seems to be working well.

                    <span>Adam and I have wanted our podcasts to have chapters for a looooong time.

They‚Äôre such a great way to navigate and explore an episode. You can skip directly to the subjects that interest you, skip past the ones that don‚Äôt, and even discover new parts of the show1 that pique your interest.
I‚Äôm a big chapters user myself; have been ever since the feature was added to my podcast app of choice and some podcasts I listen to added them. But we never put in the work to chapter our podcasts because of various challenges in our way.
The challenges
We‚Äôve self-hosted (and self-content-managed) our podcasts since 2016. To get that done, we built our own web app because, well, we‚Äôre software developers2 and as the saying goes:

Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.
We might need to give this a spin on our transcripts. Who knows, maybe our next big innovation could be The Changelog in German, French, Spanish, etc!

I‚Äôm not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices around architecting CSS. Before we get lost rethinking the wheel, let‚Äôs hold on to some good principles from the past decade or so:
We want to author in components
We generally want low-specificity to avoid collisions
We want a bucket of global utility classes/variables for ad-hoc composition or customizations
With those principles, let‚Äôs dive into some CSS architecture alternatives.

                    <span>iliana etaoin:
There is a lot of attention on securing ‚Äúsoftware supply chains.‚Äù The usual approach is that you want to try to avoid security issues in your underlying components from impacting customers of your product; and when they do, you want to be able to respond quickly to fix the issue. The people who care about this class of problem are often software companies. The class of components that are most concerning these companies are ones where unpaid hobbyist maintainers wrote something for themselves with no maintenance plan.
This is where the supply chain metaphor ‚Äî and it is just that, a metaphor ‚Äî breaks down‚Ä¶
I think we all know this intrinsically, but it‚Äôs easy to forget. iliana goes on to describe feelings I‚Äôve heard expressed by a few maintainers recently:
I just want to publish software that I think is neat so that other hobbyists can use and learn from it, and I otherwise want to be left the hell alone. I should be allowed to decide if something I wrote is ‚Äúdone‚Äù. The focus on securing the ‚Äúsoftware supply chain‚Äù has made it even more likely that releasing software for others to use will just mean more work for me that I don‚Äôt benefit from. I reject the idea that a concept so tenuous can be secured in the first place.

                    <span>WeightWatcher, created by Charles Martin, is an open source diagnostic tool for analyzing Neural Networks without training or even test data! Charles joins us in this episode to discuss the tool and how it fills certain gaps in current model evaluation workflows. Along the way, we discuss statistical methods from physics and a variety of practical ways to modify your training runs.

                    <span>Here‚Äôs Paul Graham with some wise advice he‚Äôs learned from YC‚Äôs users ‚Äî this also tees up a large conversation on this Friday‚Äôs episode of The Changelog (talk to your users).
I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice I could give for getting in, per word, was. Explain what you‚Äôve learned from users.
Here‚Äôs why that makes sense.
That tests a lot of things: whether you‚Äôre paying attention to users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need what you‚Äôre making.
But giving this advice made Paul consider what he has learned from YC‚Äôs users (the startups they‚Äôve funded). This one is almost clich√© at this point, but still quite true.
Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don‚Äôt have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don‚Äôt matter, there‚Äôs no one focusing on the things that do.
