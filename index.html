                <p>Penetration testing, aka pen testing or ethical hacking, attempts to attempt to breach a system's security for the purpose of vulnerability identification. Testing is done in an authorized and structured manner to report and rectify so that weaknesses can be reported and rectified.</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>When it comes to scaling, we might need to think about:
data storage, if we store more and more data and it becomes expensive or slow working with them
fast INSERTs and UPDATES for write-heavy workloads
making SELECT queries faster because of their complexity or because they need to query huge amounts of data
concurrency if we have many clients interacting with the database
In this article, I will present some basic ideas and starting points on scaling traditional SQL databases.

                <p>WWDC21 wasn’t the most exciting Apple keynote ever (especially for those of us hoping for some new hardware), but there were a lot of software things announced. Apple continues to iterate on Swift, and the new 5.5 beta has some really cool stuff in it. InfoQ has the rundown on its two flagship improvements.

                <p>Don Watkins:
Mark Van Doren said, “the art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.” I saw that play out in this classroom using open source tools. More students need opportunities like this to help them gain a quality education. The Raspberry Pi 400 is a great form factor for teaching and learning.
Such a cool program that’d be easy to reproduce in your local library.

                <p>When it comes to open source, we came for the code, but we stayed for the people. Some of the best, brightest, &amp; kindest people we’ve met over our years doing The Changelog are maintainers of open source software.
We’ve been working (alongside others) to support, encourage, and shine our spotlight on these amazing people for awhile now, so it was exciting to hear that our friends at GitHub and Tidelift were organizing Maintainer Week.

Today we’re talking Brett Cannon. Brett is Dev Manager of the Python Extension for VS Code, Python Steering Council Member, and core team member for Python. He recently shared a blog post The social contract of open source, so we invited Brett to join us for Maintainer Week to discuss this topic in detail.

                <p>Miroslav Nikolov:
You may not be a project manager. Perhaps you are a developer who likes to code and solve technical challenges. The organizational matter is something you care less about. After all, your company is likely relying on some agile methods and there are product owners and/or SCRUM masters to handle the process. You just need to build new features.
While that’s true you have to sometimes get out of your comfort zone.

Your HTML doesn’t need to be messy. DaisyUI adds component classes to Tailwind CSS. Classes like btn, card, etc… No need to deal with hundreds of utility classes.
No script dependencies. 2KB gzipped. Worth a look.

When I first saw “Avengers: Endgame” in theaters, I noticed that their time travel rule is quite similar to the Git branching model. Referred to as the time heist, our heroes travelled through time to recover the stones…
I had to truncate that pull quote to avoid Avengers spoilers. If you’ve seen the movie (or don’t care about getting spoiled) there’s some good Git knowledge to be gained from this analogy.

One of the main challenges of evaluating Rust for use within the Android platform was ensuring we could provide sufficient interoperability with our existing codebase. If Rust is to meet its goals of improving security, stability, and quality Android-wide, we need to be able to use Rust anywhere in the codebase that native code is required. To accomplish this, we need to provide the majority of functionality platform developers use. As we discussed p…</p>

                <p>When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.

Postgres has had “JSON” support for nearly 10 years now. I put JSON in quotes because well, 10 years ago when we announced JSON support we kinda cheated.

You’ll learn CSS fundamentals like the box model, cascade and specificity, flexbox, grid and z-index. And, along with these fundamentals, you’ll learn about functions, color types, gradients, logical properties and inheritance to make you a well-rounded front-end developer, ready to take on any user interface.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>WireGuard Easy uses Docker to set up WireGuard VPN along with a web UI for easy management. While this may be the easiest way to get up and running, I’d still advise checking out Algo VPN as well since it’s also pretty easy and has been designed/configured with maximum security in mind. Still, this looks cool and the web admin UI makes it quite approachable as well.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>rpg-cli is a bare-bones JRPG-inspired terminal game written in Rust. It can work as an alternative to cd where you randomly encounter enemies as you change directories.
You’ll want to practice a bit first, then once you get good at it go ahead and override the builtin cd by adding this function to your bash profile.
cd () {
   rpg-cli &quot;$@&quot;
   builtin cd &quot;$(rpg-cli --pwd)&quot;

                <p>Tools and frameworks that aim to boost developer productivity are always worth a closer look, but we don’t often consider the trade-offs for whichever we settle on. In this episode, we discuss the questions one should be asking when evaluating developer productivity tools and frameworks in the Go ecosystem in particular.
Joining us to discuss is André Eriksson, the creator of Encore, a backend framework that aims to make development and deployment as productive as it can be.

                <p>Within the decade, Google aims to build a useful, error-corrected quantum computer. This will accelerate solutions for some of the world’s most pressing problems, like sustainable energy and reduced emissions to feed the world’s growing population, and unlocking new scientific discoveries, like more helpful AI.


To begin our journey, today we’re unveiling our new Quantum AI campus in Santa Barbara, California. This campus includes our first quantum data center, our quantum hardware research laboratories, a…</p>

                <p>We've always had a soft spot for language at Google. Early on, we set out to translate the web. More recently, we’ve invented machine learning techniques that help us better grasp the intent of Search queries. Over time, our advances in these and other areas have made it easier and easier to organize and access the heaps of information conveyed by the written and spoken word.
But there’s always room for improvement. Language is remarkably nuanced and adaptable. It can be literal or figurative, flowery or pl…</p>

                <p>Ashley Kolodziej speaking directly to HTML:
You are the foundation of the Internet. You are the bridge between humans and information. When we say HTML isn’t an expertise in and of itself, when we take you for granted, we leave behind the people and systems who access that information using web crawlers and accessibility technology.
and CSS:
There is a time and place for specificity, and I cherish your ability to manage that. I love your system of overrides, of thinking ahead to what should and shouldn’t be…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>It’s fun seeing the proliferation of TODO comments over time on these bastions of open source. One not-surprising (but still unfortunate) trend: they all pretty much move up and to the right 📈, but a few have had some dramatic reversals 📉 at certain points in time. Go had a crazy month in April 2018 &amp; TypeScript’s TODOs exploded in the Spring of 2018.

                <p>There are a lot of screencasts, recordings of user group gatherings and conference talks available online. I try to commit myself watching at least two new talks every week, and I’ve been doing this for quite some time now. I created this list of online talks that I really enjoyed watching. I’ll also be updating this list whenever I’ve watched another awesome talk that is worthy enough. Suggestions are always appreciated through a pull request.
