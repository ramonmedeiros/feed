Code at Scale
At Google, tens of thousands of software engineers contribute to a multi-billion-line mono-repository. This repository, stored in a system called Piper, contains the source code of shared libraries, production services, experimental programs, diagnostic and debugging tools: basically anything that&#x27;s code-related.

This open approach can be very powerful. For example, if an engineer is unsure how to use a library, they can find examples just by searching. It also allows kind-hearted individuals to perform important updates across the whole repository, be that migrating to newer APIs, or following language developments such as Python 3, or Go generics.

Code, however, doesn&#x27;t come for free: it&#x27;s expensive to produce, but also costs real engineering time to mainta‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Posted by Rae Wang, Director of Product Management (Android Security and Privacy Team) 


Unlike other mobile OSes, Android is built with a transparent, open-source architecture. We firmly believe that our users and the mobile ecosystem at-large should be able to verify Android‚Äôs security and safety and not just take our word for it. 
The Assurance of Android Protected Confirmation
announced they‚Äôre working with Google on a pilot project to establish Protected Confirmation as a common application programmable interface standard. In a pilot planned for 2023, UBS online banking customers with Pixel 6 or 7 devices can use Android Protected Confirmation backed by StrongBox, a certified hardware vault with physical attack protections, to confirm payments and verify online purchases through a hardware-based confirmation in their UBS Access App. 


Demonstrating Real-World Use for Android Protection Confirmation


We‚Äôve been working closely with UBS to bring this pilot to life and ensure they‚Äôre able to test it on Google Pixel devices. Demonstrating real-world use cases that are enabled by Android Protected Confirmation unlocks the promise of this technology by delivering improved and innovative experiences for our users. We‚Äôre seeing interest in Android Protected Confirmation across the industry and OEMs are increasingly looking at how to build even more hardware-based confirmation into critical security user moments. We look forward to forming an industry alliance that will work together to strengthen mobile security and home in on protecting confirmation support.</span>

Last week the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) announced the release of SLSA v1.0, a framework that helps secure the software supply chain. Ten years of using an internal version of SLSA at Google has shown that it‚Äôs crucial to warding off tampering and keeping software secure. It‚Äôs especially gratifying to see SLSA reaching v1.0 as an open source project‚Äîcontributors have come together to produce solutions that will benefit everyone.

Many web applications need to display user-controlled content. This can be as simple as serving user-uploaded images (e.g. profile photos), or as complex as rendering user-controlled HTML (e.g. a web development tutorial). This has always been difficult to do securely, so we‚Äôve worked to find easy, but secure solutions that can be applied to most types of web applications. 

Classical Solutions for Isolating Untrusted Content
‚Äúsandbox domains‚Äù. The basic idea is that if your application&#x27;s main domain is example.com, you could serve all untrusted content on exampleusercontent.com. Since these two domains are cross-site, any malicious content on exampleusercontent.com can‚Äôt impact example.com.

Chokepoint Capitalism is about how big tech and big content have captured creative labor markets and the ways we can win them back. We talk about chokepoints creating chickenized reverse-centaurs, paying for your robot boss (think Uber, Doordash, Amazon Drivers), the chickenization that‚Äôs climbing the priviledge gradient from the most blue collar workers to the middle-class. There are chokepoints in open source, AI generative art, interoperability, music, film, and media. To quote Cory, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all fighting the same fight.‚Äù

High profile open source vulnerabilities have made it clear that securing the supply chains underpinning modern software is an urgent, yet enormous, undertaking. As supply chains get more complicated, enterprise developers need to manage the tidal wave of vulnerabilities that propagate up through dependency trees. Open source maintainers need streamlined ways to vet proposed dependencies and protect their projects. A rise in attacks coupled with increasingly complex supply chains means that supply chain security problems need solutions on the ecosystem level. 


One way developers can manage this enormous risk is by choosing a more secure language. As part of Google‚Äôs commitment to advancing‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What can art historians and computer scientists learn from one another? Actually, a lot! Amanda Wasielewski joins us to talk about how she discovered that computer scientists working on computer vision were actually acting like rogue art historians and how art historians have found machine learning to be a valuable tool for research, fraud detection, and cataloguing. We also discuss the rise of generative AI and how we this technology might cause us to ask new questions like: ‚ÄúWhat makes a photograph a photograph?‚Äù

Today, we are excited to announce the deps.dev API, which provides free access to the deps.dev dataset of security metadata, including dependencies, licenses, advisories, and other critical health and security signals for more than 50 million open source package versions.


Software supply chain attacks are increasingly common and harmful, with high profile incidents such as Log4Shell, Codecov, and the recent 3CX hack. The overwhelming complexity of the software ecosystem causes trouble for even the most diligent and well-resourced developers. 


We hope the deps.dev API will help the community make sense of complex dependency data that allows them to respond to‚Äîor even prevent‚Äîthese types of attacks. By integ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>TIL that four corporate publishers have sued the Internet Archive for copyright infringement.
When Julius Caesar burned the Library of Alexandria, it was hard to imagine a greater destruction of scholarship. Now, 2,000 years later, some petty, litigious schmucks are ready to deal an even bigger blow to the literary canon.

                    <span>Andy Baio with the eagle eyes ü¶Ö
While trying to fix my printer today, I discovered that a PDF copy of Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs Bitcoin whitepaper apparently shipped with every copy of macOS since Mojave in 2018.
I‚Äôve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them. The file is found in every version of macOS from Mojave (10.14.0) to the current version, Ventura (13.3), but isn‚Äôt in High Sierra (10.13) or earlier.
Well that‚Äôs a fun bit of trivia! But why?
Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple? The filename is ‚Äúsimpledoc.pdf‚Äù and it‚Äôs only 184 KB. Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDF for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.

Exactly six years ago (to the day!), Stripe acquired Indie Hackers to help us grow and inspire millions of people building online businesses.
Today, I‚Äôm happy to announce that @channingallen and I are indie hackers again!
So what now?
Well, if we want to survive and thrive, we‚Äôre going to have to generate revenue just like any other business! I‚Äôm an entrepreneur at heart and always have been. In fact, working at Stripe was my first and only salaried job.
Right now we‚Äôre sitting at exactly $0 in MRR, so the journey is just now (re)starting.
Welcome back to the club, guys! Exciting times üíØ

                    <span>+10x engineers may be mythical, but -10x engineers exist. To become a -10x engineer, simply waste 400 engineering hours per week. Combine the following strategies:
I know the 10x developer is a myth and all, but one thing we don‚Äôt talk about very often is that it is sometimes easy to out-pace other devs simply by moving forward at a decent clip.
This is because there are easy (yet non-obvious) ways to make negative progress as a developer. It‚Äôs not hard to move orders of magnitude faster than someone who‚Äôs headed in the wrong direction.

                    <span>Running live demos can be stressful. You know what you want to say and show. You prepare the CLI commands you want to run to best showcase what you‚Äôve built, but then you waste time typing long commands; you make typos; the commands fail or take way too long to complete. Maybe they depend on external system (network, APIs, cloud, ‚Ä¶) and of course it‚Äôs not cooperating while you‚Äôre running your live demo.
Here‚Äôs how you can avoid all of the above by scripting, automating and recording your demos, so that you never have to stress about showcasing ever again‚Ä¶

few  patches that completely removed XUL layout from the Firefox codebase.


 This means that (modulo a few exceptions documented below) all the Firefox UI is using regular web technology to render (mostly CSS flexbox).


 This was a rather big effort (first filed 9 years ago in bug 1033225), and I wanted to document some of the things that I learned during the process, some of the things and decisions that made it possible, and some of the things that I would‚Äôve maybe done differently.

GitHub private repos lull us into lazy thinking.
We cram our secrets into git, then shove it off to the most expansive code forge in the history of humanity, and most of the time: everything‚Äôs fine.
But GitHub‚Äôs ssh host key leak last week demonstrates that private repos are, at best, private-ish.
