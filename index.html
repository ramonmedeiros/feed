                    <span>Lots of cool stuff for Markdown authors in April’s VS Code release. Namely:
drag and drop files into the editor to create a Markdown link
find all references to header|links|files|urls inside of Markdown
rename headers|links inside Markdown (and propagate the changes)
rename Markdown files (and propagate to all references)
The Dendron team is excited because their primary vault hosts over 400k lines of Markdown 🤯
VS Code, and IDEs more broadly, help developers manage large code bases by making available tools to leverage and manipulate the syntax of programming languages. By shifting some of this tooling to markdown, can we do the same for large Markdown repositories?

                    <span>I’ve long been fascinated by literate programming (the art of writing code as if it was a novel), but it’s been awhile since I’ve seen a good example of in practice. Here’s a good one:
I wanted to showcase the BDD-inspired low-tech solution I came up with via a toy project, demonstrating a small but significant programming task, broken down as series of design-implementation cycles.
Wordle is a perfect target: it’s a small codebase, with a half dozen features to string together into a useable game.
This story has five chapters and a satisfying conclusion:
This project was my first foray into literate programming at this scale, an attempt to bring together all the good ideas of TDD, modern Python development, Gherkin usage for requirements traceability purposes (without overly zealous extremes of Cucumber automation). All these ideas were until now scattered, implemented each without the others in different places, and this project fuses them into something I hope is more valuable than the sum of its parts.

Woody leads Mob Programming workshops, he’s a speaker on agile related topics, and coaches and guides orgs interested in creating an environment where people can do their best work. We talk through it all and we even get some amazing advice from Woody’s dad. We define what Mob Programming is and why it’s so effective. Is it a rigid process or can teams flex to make it work for them? How to introduce mob programming to a team. What kind of groundwork is necessary? And of course, are mob programming’s virtues diminished by remote teams in virtual-only settings?

                    <span>Andraž Bajt:
Basic premise is: browsers are great at navigating pages, let’s leverage that by serving users directly with HTML. This already gives you half-decent pages but you can go further and sprinkle on some sugar. A bit of JS. Instead of reinventing the world in JS let’s try to really use what modern browsers provide natively and then push just a bit forward.
Is the pendulum starting to swing away from SPAs/client-side rendering and back toward MPAs/server-side rendering? Will we ever find balance somewhere in the middle?

                    <span>Mike Hanley on GitHub’s blog:
The software supply chain starts with the developer. Developer accounts are frequent targets for social engineering and account takeover, and protecting developers from these types of attacks is the first and most critical step toward securing the supply chain…
Today, as part of a platform-wide effort to secure the software ecosystem through improving account security, we’re announcing that GitHub will require all users who contribute code on GitHub.com to enable one or more forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) by the end of 2023.
This is a big step in the right direction and their new(ish) 2FA for GitHub Mobile feature helps make the burden not as cumbersome as it might be otherwise.

It was during the onsite day, where a batch of 20 or so applicants were put through various tests in an IBM office. They called it the “group test”; around 8 of us were led to a room and asked to solve a puzzle together.

                    <span>This week Peer Richelsen, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Cal.com, joins the show to talk about building the “Stripe for Time” — with a grand mission to connect a billion people by 2031 through calendar scheduling. Cal has grown from an open-source side project to one of the fastest-growing commercial open source companies. We get into all the details — what it means to be an open source Calendly alternative, how they quantify connecting a Billion people by 2031, where there’s room for innovation in the scheduling space, and why being community first is part of their secret sauce.

I was working on bioinformatics a few years ago and was amazed by those single-word bash commands which are much faster than my dull scripts, time saved through learning command-line shortcuts and scripting.
Recent years I am working on cloud computing and I keep recording those useful commands here. Not all of them is oneliner, but I put effort on making them brief and swift. I am mainly using Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, RedHat, Linux Mint, Mac and CentOS, sorry if the commands don’t work on your system.

                    <span>Today we talk to Mark Ericksen about all the things that we could be doing on the new platform - this is a follow-up to episode 50.
Mark specialises in Elixir, he hosts the Thinking Elixir podcast, and he also helps make Fly.io the best place to run Phoenix apps, such as changelog.com. In the interest of holding our new platform right, we thought that it would be a great idea to talk to someone that does this all day, every day, for many years now.
We touch up on how to run database migrations safely, and how to upgrade our application config to the latest Phoenix version. We also talked about some of the more advanced platform features that we may want to start leveraging, like the multi-region PostgreSQL.

                    <span>The coolest thing about this story is that the entire endeavor was apparently prompted by a random developer tweet! If you’ve ever wondered what all goes in to opening the source of historic software products like this one:
This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.
Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the original release who consented to keeping their names in place
The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and have been excluded
The code does not build with today’s engineering tools, and is released as-is.

You can also flip the list to translate what you are being told by someone from what they actually mean.

You’ll learn about a cool compiler optimization called “string interning”, which is used in many languages. Also, you will understand what happens when (almost any) interpreter runs your code, take a look at the AST and take a peak at the symbols interpretation at the low level.

Developers often reach for UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI, hoping that they’ll save a bunch of time and quickly build a professional-looking app. Unfortunately, things rarely work out this way. Let’s talk about it.
Stick around for the rebuttals section, too.

                    <span>Since TypeScript doesn’t follow SemVer itself, TS libraries which do want to follow SemVer need both high-level guidance about how to do that and detailed analysis of the corner cases to watch out for as well as ways to mitigate breaking changes from TS.
This doc is a (beta!) specification of SemVer for managing changes to TypeScript types, including when the TS compiler makes breaking changes in its type-checking and type emit across a “minor” release.

                    <span>Spacedrive helps you organize your files across many devices in one place. Here’s the motivation:
Many of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren’t backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.

                    <span>This is alpha software, but it seems pretty low risk to give it a try.
Wireit works with npm run, it doesn’t replace it. To configure an NPM script for Wireit, move the command into a new wireit section of your package.json, and replace the original script with the wireit command.
Now when you run npm run build, Wireit upgrades the script to be smarter and more efficient.

We are entering a new world with a new focus on giving users control over their data, their identity, and their systems. We are building distributed filesystems, distributed identity, and yes, blockchains. I think oftentimes we end up seeing only the blockchain technology due to the headlines and the financial investment, but distributed systems as a whole are taking off in a big, big way.

                    <span>The second jq alternative we’ve discovered this week! (first here)
jq is hard to use. There are alternatives like fq and zq, but they still make you learn a new programming language. Im tired of learning new programming languages.
gq is not optimized for speed, flexibility or beauty. gq is optimized for minimal learning/quick usage. gq understands that you don’t use it constantly, you use it once a month and then forget about it. So when you come back to it, gq will be easy to relearn. Just use the builtin library just like you would any other go project and you’re done. No unfamiliar syntax or operations, or surprising limits. Thats it.
I don’t know if Go is a great fit for this use-case, but if you already know it well… makes sense.

Back in 2019, I started collecting all kinds of metrics about my life. Every single day for the last 2.5 years I tracked over 100 different data types - ranging from fitness &amp; nutrition to social life, computer usage and weather.
This data produces 44 graphs that are all shared publicly on the website.

                    <span>Posted by Caleb Brown, Open Source Security Team 


Despite open source software’s essential role in all software built today, it’s far too easy for bad actors to circulate malicious packages that attack the systems and users running that software. Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute. As a result, malicious packages like ua-parser-js, and node-ipc are regularly uploaded to popular repositories despite their best efforts, with sometimes devastating consequences for users.

                    <span>The latest Common Voice dataset, released today, has achieved a major milestone: More than 20,000 hours of open-source speech data that anyone, anywhere can use. The dataset has nearly doubled in the past year. Mozilla’s Common Voice seeks to change the language technology ecosystem by supporting communities to collect voice data for the creation of voice-enabled applications for their own languages.

After migrating all our media files to AWS S3 (check episode 40), we thought that this part was going to be easy. Plan met reality. Pull request 407 has all the details.
We want to emphasise the type of partner relationships that we seek at Changelog &amp; why they are important to us, as well as to our listeners. Honeycomb &amp; Fly embody the principles that we care about, and Gerhard thinks that we are currently missing a Kubernetes partner.

                    <span>If you’ve found the (excellent) jq tool for working with JSON a bit unwieldy… check out zq and see if you like its API any better. I wouldn’t put too much weight on the faster aspect, though:
We will cover zq’s performance in a future article, but to cut to the chase here, zq is almost always at least a bit faster than jq when processing JSON inputs
Almost always at least a bit faster is not something you’re likely to notice in practice.

I know you’re going to be tempted to reply with “you’re using it wrong” - but I’m not. This is how I like to use my computer. And it is clear that the MacBook isn’t my computer - it is Apple’s. (OK, OK! It belongs to my employer!)
Some of his grievances like window snapping and moving/removing UI elements can be alleviated with 3rd-party solutions, but he’s not wrong that the operating system doesn’t provide these features.

It’s a golden age of emulation. Between increasing CPU power, WebAssembly, and retrocomputing being so popular The New York Times is covering it, it’s never been easier to relive your 80s / 90s / 2000s nostalgia. Projects like v86 make it easy to run your chosen old operating system in the browser. My heritage being of the classic Mac line, I was curious what the easiest to use emulation option was in the modern era…

Providing a safe experience to billions of users continues to be one of the highest priorities for Google Play.

In addition, Google Play Protect continues to scan billions of installed apps each day across billions of devices to keep people safe from malware and unwanted software.  
  
We continue to enhance our machine learning systems and review processes, and in 2021 we blocked 1.2 million policy violating apps from being published on Google Play, preventing billions of harmful installations. We also continued in our efforts to combat malicious and spammy developers, …</span>

                    <span>Today we’re talking with Zach Lloyd, founder of Warp — the terminal being re-imagined for the 21st century and beyond. Warp is a blazingly fast, rust-based terminal that’s being designed from the ground up to work like a modern app. We get into all the details — why now is the right time to re-invent the terminal, where they got started, the business they aim to build around Warp, what it’s going to take to gain adoption and grow, but more importantly — what’s Warp like today to get developers excited and give it a try.

We get into topics including optimization on various kinds of hardware and deployment of models at the edge.

Earlier this year he wrote a blog post titled “Practical Guide to Solving Hard Problems,” and a lot of what he had to say really resonated with us. The premise is simple — if you have to write some code that you’re just not sure how to write…what do you do? What are the practical steps that you can take when you’re feeling stumped? Today’s show goes deep on that subject…practical ways to solve hard problems and ship your best work.

                    <span>Let’s be honest: The current generation of robotic lawn mowers sucks. Basically all of these bots drive in a random direction until they hit the border of the lawn, rotate for a randomized duration and repeat. I think we can do better!
Therefore, we have disassembled the cheapest off-the-shelf robotic mower we could find (YardForce Classic 500) and were surprised that the hardware itself is actually quite decent.
The bot itself is surprisingly high quality and doesn’t need to be changed at all. We just need some better software in there.
Here’s an overview video that explains the entire idea.

                    <span>With the recent events relating to Google Analytics platform, it’s becoming very clear that the time has come for many of us to migrate from Google Analytics to different platforms.
In this article we will go over both the “Why?”, so that you can make an informed decision whether you need to migrate of not, as well as the “How?” of migrating from Google Analytics - that is, quickly and easily taking your data and moving to different analytics platform without too much hassle.

It can track memory allocations in Python code, in native extension modules, and in the Python interpreter itself. It can generate several different types of reports to help you analyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a library to perform more fine-grained profiling tasks.
It has a lot of nice outputs so you can grok what’s going on.

The system delivered 16 millions of orders in 10 years, and 4.5 million in the last year alone. All the numbers are going up, and there is only so much that a single PHP monolith deployed as VM images can handle. So how do you even start thinking about the architectural improvements, and inspire everyone involved to move towards better?
We encourage you to look at the architectural diagrams in the show notes, especially the 10 year roadmap, and ask Alex for a blog post follow-up. While today’s episode was a good conversation starter, there is a lot that we did not h…</span>

AMP harms users’ privacy, security and internet experience, and just as bad, AMP helps Google further monopolize and control the direction of the Web.
The Brave team is really doubling down on privacy and security. I don’t think that strategy would’ve won users a few years ago, but in 2022 and beyond…

                    <span>This guide by Josh Comeau is Josh doing what Josh does so well: taking complex/arcane/technical topics and making them approachable &amp; fun for his audience.
It takes years of practice to become a terminal guru, but here’s the good news: we can take a shortcut. We don’t really need to know 98% of the stuff you can do with a terminal. If we focus on the most-important critical fundamentals, we should be able to become comfortable with the command line in a remarkably short amount of time. ✨
That’s what this blog post is all about.

                    <span>I thought Ali and Jen had some excellent advice in this segment of our JS Party episode on web dev for beginners, so I’m re-sharing it here in hopes that you might share it with people you know who may be stuck in the early phases of their web development path.
I also like what I had to say (imagine that!)
One thing that is true about software development in general… is that it’s actually really hard. And we need to just say that. Because you’re gonna hit bumps. You’re gonna hit walls. And some people will power through those walls and other people won’t, and that’s just the way life is…
But I think having something real that you want to exist… having a real project that you want to see into the world helps you get through those moments.

                    <span>Supabase CTO Ant Wilson walks through the pros &amp; cons of open sourcing your startup and why he believes the answer to the question in the headline is (probably) “yes”
Open-sourcing Supabase ended up surprising us in many ways. Many people imagine that maintaining your business in public might be burdensome - but the opposite is true. There are many unexpected upsides that have made building Supabase - the product and the company - easier.
While some of this advice comes from our lens as a Dev Tools or PaaS company, most of it will apply to any software company.

                    <span>Sounds like Jacob Kaplan-Moss isn’t the only hiring manager who’s keen on the reverse code review:
When hiring developers, there are many things we are looking for, but over the years I have found that raw coding ability is easily the most important quality to look for.   I can quickly train a person to have knowledge in some domain, but I’ve never seen raw coding ability come from anything other than personal commitment to extensive and deep practice.   Because of this, I have found that some methods work better than others to discover talent.
… instead of writing code, consider instead having the candidate read existing code and talk about what it does and how it works. This offers some powerful advantages:
The advantages in brief:
Reading probes the most fundamental skills
Reading code is way more efficient than writing.
Reading puts candidates at ease compared to writing code.
Click through for the details and how to put this in to practice.

                    <span>A tragic tale, but one worth sharing because we can all learn from their mistake:
Due to an unfortunate sequence of events, I accidentally made the project’s repository private for a moment. And GitHub cascade-deleted our community that took 10 years to build.
Whoops! This reminds me of the time I thought it’d be cute to set JSPartyFM’s Twitter birth date to the day our first episode shipped, which immediately resulted in the account being suspended for being too young.
Sounds like GitHub isn’t up for restoring their stars, so if you were following HTTPie before, you’ll want to head over there and give ’em a re-star.

The reason we find ourselves as practitioners (as an industry as a whole) constantly migrating between different platforms, journeys, and digital transformations…
We do this because I don’t think we ever understood the fundamentals.
The fundamentals are very clear. If you’re thinking about application delivery, for example, we know what the fundamentals are.
Ideally, we’re versioning the source code we write, and using tools that enable us to build and package applications in a reproducible way. 15 years ago …</span>

                    <span>Gergely Orosz did an excellent job detailing the ins &amp; outs of Atlassian’s epic outage:
Hundreds of companies have no access to JIRA, Confluence and OpsGenie. What can engineering teams learn from the poor handling of this outage?
The TL;DR on the cause of the outage is a script that was supposed to “mark for deletion” some records also had “permanently delete” functionality and was run against a wrong list of IDs, improperly deleting 400 of their customers. Oh, and their backup restore process is really good at doing all customers, but not a subset. Ruh roh!
Lots to learn here, and Gergely puts a fine point on the biggest takeaways. A must-read!

DNS is simple enough that you can grok it quickly, but still complex enough that Adam learned a ton along the way: reading RFCs, network sockets, Bitvec, and more.

In our last two posts (1,2) we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to SLSA and covered the basics and details of how they’d use SLSA for their organizations. Today we’ll close out the series by exploring how each organization pulls together the various solutions into a heterogeneous supply chain. 
As a reminder, Acme is trying to produce a container image that contains three artifacts:

The Squirrel package ‘foo’
The Oppy package ‘baz’
A custom executable, ‘bar’, written by Acme employees.
The process starts with ‘foo’ package authors triggering a build using GitHub Actions. This results in a new version of ‘foo’ (an artifact with hash ‘abc’) being pushed to the Squirrel repo along with its SLSA proven…</span>

While you may remember Sam &amp; Solomon from episode 23, this time we assembled all four superheroes in this story and went deeper, covering nearly three years of refinements, the launch, as well as the world-class team &amp; community that is coming together to solve the next problem of shipping software. Container images and Kubernetes are great steps in the right direction, but now it’s time for the next leap into the future.
You can use Dagger to run your CI/CD pipelines locally, without needing to commit and push. You can also use Dagger as a Makefile alternative, which resonates with Gerhard, but go further and your perspective on documentation &amp; automation may start shifting.

                    <span>On our episode with Brian Kernighan, I asked him if there were ever a situation in which he would advise you start a new program in C today. His response:
I think probably unless you are in one of these resource-constrained environments, clearly, right upfront, that you’re going to be resource-constrained and the improvement of hardware isn’t gonna rescue you in the next couple of years, I would not start with C. I really wouldn’t. And then it depends what is your application.
As if on queue, StackOverflow blogger Marcin Pasinski has done a comparison between C and Go in the quintessential resource-constrained environment. Oddly enough, no mention of TinyGo in the piece, but otherwise a solid analysis.

In our last post we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to use SLSA and covered the basics of what their implementations might look like. Today we’ll cover the details: where to store attestations and policies, what policies should check, and how to handle key distribution and trust.

Attestation storage
Attestations play a large role in SLSA and it’s essential that consumers of artifacts know where to find the attestations for those artifacts.

Co-located in repo

Attestations could be colocated in the repository that hosts the artifact. This is how Squirrel plans to store attestations for packages. They even want to add support to the Squirrel CLI (e.g. acorn get-attestations foo@1.2.3).

                    <span>Nils Norman Haukås:
I have been a big fan of the write libraries, not frameworks argument for a while now. Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.
I don’t disagree!
The challenge with principles &amp; patterns is they are more difficult to formalize (and communicate) than libraries &amp; frameworks because they’re by nature less specific and more meta (lowercase “m” ftw).
In other words, libraries &amp; frameworks are an end product. Principles &amp; patterns are means to an end. It’s easier to ship a product than to ship the means to it.
The latter is the realm of documentation, education, and conversation.

One of the great benefits of SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is its flexibility. As an open source framework designed to improve the integrity of software packages and infrastructure, it is as applicable to small open source projects as to enterprise organizations. But with this flexibility can come a bewildering array of options for beginners—much like salsa dancing, someone just starting out might be left on the dance floor wondering how and where to jump in.
Though it’s tempting to try to establish a single standard for how to use SLSA, it’s not possible: SLSA is not a line dance where everyone does the same moves, at the same time, to the same song. It’s a varied system with different styles, moves, and flourishe…</span>

                    <span>Dan Luu:
Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.
Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero how one might build out a simple monolith… Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith.
He goes on to describe boring choices they’ve made and  counter-balances that some by also describing why they’ve made some more complex choices such as GraphQL and Kubernetes. An excellent, nuanced piece.

                    <span>Mike Lapidakis thinks Apple’s Hide My Email feature that debuted in iOS 15 is “one of the most under-rated privacy launches of the past year.”
I’m a huge fan of the service and think the practice of a unique email per site is nearly as essential as using a unique password. When it’s this easy, you have no excuse.

When was the last time you completed a project? When was the last time you started a project? Have you every felt that you were trapped working on something that you don’t enjoy anymore? Size is something that I’m sure most developers with the drive to do side projects have felt. Recently I have been completing more projects with more success than ever before. This is my new process.
His 4-step process is so simple it might be brilliant.
