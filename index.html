                    <span>Spacedrive helps you organize your files across many devices in one place. Here’s the motivation:
Many of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren’t backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.

                    <span>This is alpha software, but it seems pretty low risk to give it a try.
Wireit works with npm run, it doesn’t replace it. To configure an NPM script for Wireit, move the command into a new wireit section of your package.json, and replace the original script with the wireit command.
Now when you run npm run build, Wireit upgrades the script to be smarter and more efficient.

                    <span>This post by Chris de la Iglesia starts off very down on blockchains, but ends up not so down after all:
We are entering a new world with a new focus on giving users control over their data, their identity, and their systems. We are building distributed filesystems, distributed identity, and yes, blockchains. I think oftentimes we end up seeing only the blockchain technology due to the headlines and the financial investment, but distributed systems as a whole are taking off in a big, big way.

                    <span>The second jq alternative we’ve discovered this week! (first here)
jq is hard to use. There are alternatives like fq and zq, but they still make you learn a new programming language. Im tired of learning new programming languages.
gq is not optimized for speed, flexibility or beauty. gq is optimized for minimal learning/quick usage. gq understands that you don’t use it constantly, you use it once a month and then forget about it. So when you come back to it, gq will be easy to relearn. Just use the builtin library just like you would any other go project and you’re done. No unfamiliar syntax or operations, or surprising limits. Thats it.
I don’t know if Go is a great fit for this use-case, but if you already know it well… makes sense.

Despite open source software’s essential role in all software built today, it’s far too easy for bad actors to circulate malicious packages that attack the systems and users running that software. Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute. As a result, malicious packages like ua-parser-js, and node-ipc are regularly uploaded to popular repositories despite their best efforts, with sometimes devastating consequences for users.

                    <span>Almost a month ago, we announced MDN Plus, a new premium service on MDN that allows users to customize their experience on the website.
We are very glad to announce today that it is now possible for MDN users around the globe to create an MDN Plus free account, no matter where they are.
The post MDN Plus now available in more markets appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

                    <span>This is our 5th Kaizen where we talk about the next improvement to changelog.com: we are now running on fly.io and our PostgreSQL is managed. This is a migration that many were curious about, including Simey de Klerk, the person that requested this episode.
After migrating all our media files to AWS S3 (check episode 40), we thought that this part was going to be easy. Plan met reality. Pull request 407 has all the details.
We want to emphasise the type of partner relationships that we seek at Changelog &amp; why they are important to us, as well as to our listeners. Honeycomb &amp; Fly embody the principles that we care about, and Gerhard thinks that we are currently missing a Kubernetes partner.

                    <span>If you’ve found the (excellent) jq tool for working with JSON a bit unwieldy… check out zq and see if you like its API any better. I wouldn’t put too much weight on the faster aspect, though:
We will cover zq’s performance in a future article, but to cut to the chase here, zq is almost always at least a bit faster than jq when processing JSON inputs
Almost always at least a bit faster is not something you’re likely to notice in practice.

                    <span>A solid rant by Terence Eden, who has to use macOS for work but would rather not:
I know you’re going to be tempted to reply with “you’re using it wrong” - but I’m not. This is how I like to use my computer. And it is clear that the MacBook isn’t my computer - it is Apple’s. (OK, OK! It belongs to my employer!)
Some of his grievances like window snapping and moving/removing UI elements can be alleviated with 3rd-party solutions, but he’s not wrong that the operating system doesn’t provide these features.

It’s a golden age of emulation. Between increasing CPU power, WebAssembly, and retrocomputing being so popular The New York Times is covering it, it’s never been easier to relive your 80s / 90s / 2000s nostalgia. Projects like v86 make it easy to run your chosen old operating system in the browser. My heritage being of the classic Mac line, I was curious what the easiest to use emulation option was in the modern era…
Here’s a video demo of what resulted: a full-featured classic 68K Mac in your browser.

Providing a safe experience to billions of users continues to be one of the highest priorities for Google Play. Last year we introduced multiple privacy focused features, enhanced our protections against bad apps and developers, and improved SDK data safety. In addition, Google Play Protect continues to scan billions of installed apps each day across billions of devices to keep people safe from malware and unwanted software.  
  
We continue to enhance our machine learning systems and review processes, and in 2021 we blocked 1.2 million policy violating apps from being published on Google Play, preventing billions of harmful installations. We also continued in our efforts to combat malicious and spammy developers, …</span>

Warp is a blazingly fast, rust-based terminal that’s being designed from the ground up to work like a modern app. We get into all the details — why now is the right time to re-invent the terminal, where they got started, the business they aim to build around Warp, what it’s going to take to gain adoption and grow, but more importantly — what’s Warp like today to get developers excited and give it a try.

                    <span>Frank Krueger joined us to talk about solving hard problems. Earlier this year he wrote a blog post titled “Practical Guide to Solving Hard Problems,” and a lot of what he had to say really resonated with us. The premise is simple — if you have to write some code that you’re just not sure how to write…what do you do? What are the practical steps that you can take when you’re feeling stumped? Today’s show goes deep on that subject…practical ways to solve hard problems and ship your best work.
Frank has his own podcast called Merge Conflict — check it out at mergeconflict.fm.

                    <span>Let’s be honest: The current generation of robotic lawn mowers sucks. Basically all of these bots drive in a random direction until they hit the border of the lawn, rotate for a randomized duration and repeat. I think we can do better!
Therefore, we have disassembled the cheapest off-the-shelf robotic mower we could find (YardForce Classic 500) and were surprised that the hardware itself is actually quite decent.
The bot itself is surprisingly high quality and doesn’t need to be changed at all. We just need some better software in there.
Here’s an overview video that explains the entire idea.

It can track memory allocations in Python code, in native extension modules, and in the Python interpreter itself. It can generate several different types of reports to help you analyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a library to perform more fine-grained profiling tasks.
It has a lot of nice outputs so you can grok what’s going on.

                    <span>On March 1st, 2022, MDN Web Docs released a new design and a new brand identity. Overall, the community responded to the redesign enthusiastically and we received many positive messages and kudos. We also received valuable feedback on some of the things we didn’t get quite right, like the browser compatibility table changes as well as some accessibility and readability issues.
The post Adopting users’ design feedback appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

Since 2018, Wix has invited tens of thousands of ethical hackers worldwide to ensure new and existing features are secure. We recently met with two Wix security team members to learn how they leverage ethical hackers to detect risks before they become threats and how vulnerability insights help strengthen their security posture.</span>

                    <span>Alex Sims, a Senior Software Engineer at James &amp; James, an eCommerce fulfilment company, reached out to us about the Kaizen story of the third-party logistics (3PL) platform that he has been involved with for several years now.
The system delivered 16 millions of orders in 10 years, and 4.5 million in the last year alone. All the numbers are going up, and there is only so much that a single PHP monolith deployed as VM images can handle. So how do you even start thinking about the architectural improvements, and inspire everyone involved to move towards better?
We encourage you to look at the architectural diagrams in the show notes, especially the 10 year roadmap, and ask Alex for a blog post follow-up. While today’s episode was a good conversation starter, there is a lot that we did not h…</span>

                    <span>Brave is rolling out a new feature called De-AMP, which allows Brave users to bypass Google-hosted AMP pages, and instead visit the content’s publisher directly. AMP harms users’ privacy, security and internet experience, and just as bad, AMP helps Google further monopolize and control the direction of the Web.
The Brave team is really doubling down on privacy and security. I don’t think that strategy would’ve won users a few years ago, but in 2022 and beyond…

                    <span>This guide by Josh Comeau is Josh doing what Josh does so well: taking complex/arcane/technical topics and making them approachable &amp; fun for his audience.
It takes years of practice to become a terminal guru, but here’s the good news: we can take a shortcut. We don’t really need to know 98% of the stuff you can do with a terminal. If we focus on the most-important critical fundamentals, we should be able to become comfortable with the command line in a remarkably short amount of time. ✨
That’s what this blog post is all about.

                    <span>I thought Ali and Jen had some excellent advice in this segment of our JS Party episode on web dev for beginners, so I’m re-sharing it here in hopes that you might share it with people you know who may be stuck in the early phases of their web development path.
I also like what I had to say (imagine that!)
One thing that is true about software development in general… is that it’s actually really hard. And we need to just say that. Because you’re gonna hit bumps. You’re gonna hit walls. And some people will power through those walls and other people won’t, and that’s just the way life is…
But I think having something real that you want to exist… having a real project that you want to see into the world helps you get through those moments.

                    <span>Today, HackerOne published The 2022 Attack Resistance Report: A HackerOne Security Survey. Our research revealed an increasing gap—the attack resistance gap—between what organizations can defend and what they need to defend. The gap is the result of four components prevalent across organizations.</span>

                    <span>Supabase CTO Ant Wilson walks through the pros &amp; cons of open sourcing your startup and why he believes the answer to the question in the headline is (probably) “yes”
Open-sourcing Supabase ended up surprising us in many ways. Many people imagine that maintaining your business in public might be burdensome - but the opposite is true. There are many unexpected upsides that have made building Supabase - the product and the company - easier.
While some of this advice comes from our lens as a Dev Tools or PaaS company, most of it will apply to any software company.

                    <span>Sounds like Jacob Kaplan-Moss isn’t the only hiring manager who’s keen on the reverse code review:
When hiring developers, there are many things we are looking for, but over the years I have found that raw coding ability is easily the most important quality to look for.   I can quickly train a person to have knowledge in some domain, but I’ve never seen raw coding ability come from anything other than personal commitment to extensive and deep practice.   Because of this, I have found that some methods work better than others to discover talent.
… instead of writing code, consider instead having the candidate read existing code and talk about what it does and how it works. This offers some powerful advantages:
The advantages in brief:
Reading probes the most fundamental skills
Reading code is way more efficient than writing.
Reading puts candidates at ease compared to writing code.
Click through for the details and how to put this in to practice.

                    <span>A tragic tale, but one worth sharing because we can all learn from their mistake:
Due to an unfortunate sequence of events, I accidentally made the project’s repository private for a moment. And GitHub cascade-deleted our community that took 10 years to build.
Whoops! This reminds me of the time I thought it’d be cute to set JSPartyFM’s Twitter birth date to the day our first episode shipped, which immediately resulted in the account being suspended for being too young.
Sounds like GitHub isn’t up for restoring their stars, so if you were following HTTPie before, you’ll want to head over there and give ’em a re-star.

                    <span>What you’re about to read is a fancified excerpt from Ship It! #44. You should read the original transcript or listen to the entire conversation for more context. To set the stage, this is Kelsey’s response to Gerhard asking what the biggest takeaway should be from their conversation.
The reason we find ourselves as practitioners (as an industry as a whole) constantly migrating between different platforms, journeys, and digital transformations…
We do this because I don’t think we ever understood the fundamentals.
The fundamentals are very clear. If you’re thinking about application delivery, for example, we know what the fundamentals are.
Ideally, we’re versioning the source code we write, and using tools that enable us to build and package applications in a reproducible way. 15 years ago …</span>

                    <span>Gergely Orosz did an excellent job detailing the ins &amp; outs of Atlassian’s epic outage:
Hundreds of companies have no access to JIRA, Confluence and OpsGenie. What can engineering teams learn from the poor handling of this outage?
The TL;DR on the cause of the outage is a script that was supposed to “mark for deletion” some records also had “permanently delete” functionality and was run against a wrong list of IDs, improperly deleting 400 of their customers. Oh, and their backup restore process is really good at doing all customers, but not a subset. Ruh roh!
Lots to learn here, and Gergely puts a fine point on the biggest takeaways. A must-read!

Over the last few weeks I built my own DNS client. Mostly because I thought dig was kinda clunky. Partly because I wanted to learn more about DNS. So here’s how I built it, and how you can build your own too. It’s a great weekend project, and I learned a lot from finishing it.
DNS is simple enough that you can grok it quickly, but still complex enough that Adam learned a ton along the way: reading RFCs, network sockets, Bitvec, and more.

In our last two posts (1,2) we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to SLSA and covered the basics and details of how they’d use SLSA for their organizations. Today we’ll close out the series by exploring how each organization pulls together the various solutions into a heterogeneous supply chain. 
As a reminder, Acme is trying to produce a container image that contains three artifacts:

The Squirrel package ‘foo’
The Oppy package ‘baz’
A custom executable, ‘bar’, written by Acme employees.
The process starts with ‘foo’ package authors triggering a build using GitHub Actions. This results in a new version of ‘foo’ (an artifact with hash ‘abc’) being pushed to the Squirrel repo along with its SLSA proven…</span>

Container images and Kubernetes are great steps in the right direction, but now it’s time for the next leap into the future.
You can use Dagger to run your CI/CD pipelines locally, without needing to commit and push. You can also use Dagger as a Makefile alternative, which resonates with Gerhard, but go further and your perspective on documentation &amp; automation may start shifting.

I think probably unless you are in one of these resource-constrained environments, clearly, right upfront, that you’re going to be resource-constrained and the improvement of hardware isn’t gonna rescue you in the next couple of years, I would not start with C. I really wouldn’t. And then it depends what is your application.
As if on queue, StackOverflow blogger Marcin Pasinski has done a comparison between C and Go in the quintessential resource-constrained environment. Oddly enough, no mention of TinyGo in the piece, but otherwise a solid analysis.

In our last post we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to use SLSA and covered the basics of what their implementations might look like. Today we’ll cover the details: where to store attestations and policies, what policies should check, and how to handle key distribution and trust.

Attestation storage
Attestations play a large role in SLSA and it’s essential that consumers of artifacts know where to find the attestations for those artifacts.

Co-located in repo

Attestations could be colocated in the repository that hosts the artifact. This is how Squirrel plans to store attestations for packages. They even want to add support to the Squirrel CLI (e.g. acorn get-attestations foo@1.2.3).

                    <span>Nils Norman Haukås:
I have been a big fan of the write libraries, not frameworks argument for a while now. Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.
I don’t disagree!
The challenge with principles &amp; patterns is they are more difficult to formalize (and communicate) than libraries &amp; frameworks because they’re by nature less specific and more meta (lowercase “m” ftw).
In other words, libraries &amp; frameworks are an end product. Principles &amp; patterns are means to an end. It’s easier to ship a product than to ship the means to it.
The latter is the realm of documentation, education, and conversation.

                    <span>Posted by Tom Hennen, Software Engineer, BCID &amp; GOSST 

One of the great benefits of SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is its flexibility. As an open source framework designed to improve the integrity of software packages and infrastructure, it is as applicable to small open source projects as to enterprise organizations. But with this flexibility can come a bewildering array of options for beginners—much like salsa dancing, someone just starting out might be left on the dance floor wondering how and where to jump in.
Though it’s tempting to try to establish a single standard for how to use SLSA, it’s not possible: SLSA is not a line dance where everyone does the same moves, at the same time, to the same song. It’s a varied system with different styles, moves, and flourishe…</span>

                    <span>It was an honor and a privilege to attend a special event in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, today to launch INSAIT, the Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology. INSAIT is a new AI and computer science research institute that will provide truly world-class facilities.


It’s fantastic to see the country where I was born leading the charge in bridging Eastern Europe to the world-stage in computer science research.


The institute is modeled on the computer science departments of renowned institutions such as MIT, UC Berkeley and the Max-Planck Institute, and is backed by the Bulgarian government with an endowment fund of nearly $100 million. Its computer science and AI research will span topics such as machine learning, quantum computing, information security, r…</span>

                    <span>Dan Luu:
Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.
Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero how one might build out a simple monolith… Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith.
He goes on to describe boring choices they’ve made and  counter-balances that some by also describing why they’ve made some more complex choices such as GraphQL and Kubernetes. An excellent, nuanced piece.

When was the last time you completed a project? When was the last time you started a project? Have you every felt that you were trapped working on something that you don’t enjoy anymore? Size is something that I’m sure most developers with the drive to do side projects have felt. Recently I have been completing more projects with more success than ever before. This is my new process.

                    <span>This episode was requested by Tyler Smith who feels that he may not need Kubernetes just yet. Tyler has a few questions about Docker &amp; Docker Swarm, so Andrea Luzzardi, former Docker Swarm Lead, joins us today to answer them.
We talk about Docker Swarm beginnings, some of the challenges that it faced, and what Andrea’s recommendation is for Tyler’s journey with Docker Swarm.
After dedicating four years of his professional career to Docker Swarm, Andrea is the best person that Gerhard knows to talk about this subject. And guess what, the same thing happened now as it did at KubeCon 2015: Sam pointed to Andrea. It will all make sense in the first five minutes. This one is going to be fun!

                    <span>There’s a lot going on in that picture. Let’s take a closer look at exactly what computers and gear they were using to do the 3D animation for this game.
Why? Because, Final Fantasy 7 is a true classic. When the game was first released in early 1997, for the Sony PlayStation, it took the RPG gaming world by storm. To this day, many consider it the greatest entry in the franchise.
I remember getting this game for Christmas and playing it nearly non-stop until school started again after the new year. Greatest entry in the franchise? Easily!

                    <span>Solid piece on literate programming by Richard Gall for The New Stack. My foremost exposure to the practice came from Jeremy Ashkenas’ CoffeeScript and Backbone.js docs. I always found it cool and useful to read, but couldn’t imagine myself writing code/docs that way. Which brings us to this bit at the end of the article:
“One of the things we learned is that it’s very expensive,” he said. “And so you spend time trying to figure out what sort of situations justify the expense. And one of them is where people are building relatively small, sophisticated kernels that are going to be shared widely.”
Seems like Jeremy’s use case drilled it. If you’re mostly writing application code, literate programming probably isn’t worth the headache, but for library/framework authors…

Many of the recent high-profile software attacks that have alarmed open-source users globally were consequences of supply chain integrity vulnerabilities: attackers gained control of a build server to use malicious source files, inject malicious artifacts into a compromised build platform, and bypass trusted builders to upload malicious artifacts. 
Each of these attacks could have been prevented if there were a way to detect that the delivered artifacts diverged from the expected origin of the software. But until now, generating verifiable information that described where, when, and how software artifacts were produced (information known as provenance) was difficult. This information allows users to trace artif…</span>

                    <span>I’ve been using asdf on my new machine to manage Elixir/Erlang and Node versions and it works like a charm. Highly recommend! There are some complaints in the comments of this post about it being slow, but I haven’t had that problem yet.

                    <span>DuckDuckGo and Bing are not true alternatives – they’re just worse versions of Google.
The next Google can’t just be an input box that spits out links. We need new thinking to create something much better than what came before.
In the last few years, different groups of people came to the same conclusion, and started working on the next generation of search engines.
For this new generation, privacy is necessary, and invasive ads are not an option. But that’s where the commonalities end. Beyond that, they’ve all taken the idea of a search engine in very different directions.
The post goes on to describe &amp; detail a whole new wave of search engines. I had no idea so many people were working on this problem. Exciting!

                    <span>Asahi Linux is a project and community with the goal of porting Linux to Apple Silicon Macs, starting with the 2020 M1 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.
Our goal is not just to make Linux run on these machines but to polish it to the point where it can be used as a daily OS. Doing this requires a tremendous amount of work, as Apple Silicon is an entirely undocumented platform. In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open-source driver for it.
Asahi Linux is developed by a thriving community of free and open source software developers.
Yes, please!

At Google, we constantly invest in security research to raise the bar for our devices, keeping our users safe and building their trust in our products. In 2021, we published Google Nest security commitments, in which we committed to engage with the research community to examine our products and services and report vulnerabilities.
We are now looking to deepen this relationship and accelerate the path toward building more secure devices. Starting today, we will introduce a new vulnerability rewards structure for submissions impacting smart home (Google Nest) and wearables (Fitbit) devices through our Bug Hunters platform. 
Bonus!

We are paying higher rewards retroactively for eligible Google Nest and Fitbit devices repor…</span>

You don’t have to use a specific tool for .xit files, the basic operations like creating items or checking them off can be done in every text editor. Tools can make the experience more convenient, though, and provide support for common use cases.
The cool thing is anybody/everybody can now develop integrations for their favorite tools.

                    <span>The Squeaky team goes from dev straight to prod (same here), but many people advocate for (and use) staging or other “pre-live” environments instead.
While there are obvious benefits to deploying to different environments, at Squeaky we’ve decided to take a different approach. We only have two environments: our laptops, and production. Once we merge into the main branch, it will be immediately deployed to production.
Perhaps that sounds unusual, but so far it’s outweighed the benefits of pre-live environments, and we believe it’s helping us to ship faster, and lower the number of issues on production. So, I thought I’d write this post to share why we think it works, and why you should consider it too.
