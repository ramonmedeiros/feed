On top of that, this package also adds bitmap indexing to the columnar storage, allowing to build filter queries using binary and, and not, or and xor (see kelindar/bitmap with SIMD support).

This post is about ways of getting unstuck on a problem when you do not (yet) have all the relevant knowledge. It focuses on the problem with the ego when being a more seasoned programmer and the difficulty on admitting that you don‚Äôt know (yet).
From there we go through the steps on being unstuck and making that ego more inflated and annoying.

Regardless of that, it‚Äôs great to see the Deno community building foundational tools like this.

I‚Äôve been tasked with leading frontend. As a result, I‚Äôve been teaching a whole lot of people about the web.
Knowing where we came from can help us figure out where we should go. It‚Äôs also a mountain of technical debt, and we‚Äôre collectively building on top of it.
Forgive me if I skip the wonderful stories of Macromedia Flash, Java in the browser, or whatever other detour you can think of. While those were important to development of the web, most of us will never run into them again.

                <p>When it comes to scaling, we might need to think about:
data storage, if we store more and more data and it becomes expensive or slow working with them
fast INSERTs and UPDATES for write-heavy workloads
making SELECT queries faster because of their complexity or because they need to query huge amounts of data
concurrency if we have many clients interacting with the database
In this article, I will present some basic ideas and starting points on scaling traditional SQL databases.

                <p>Miroslav Nikolov:
You may not be a project manager. Perhaps you are a developer who likes to code and solve technical challenges. The organizational matter is something you care less about. After all, your company is likely relying on some agile methods and there are product owners and/or SCRUM masters to handle the process. You just need to build new features.
While that‚Äôs true you have to sometimes get out of your comfort zone.

Your HTML doesn‚Äôt need to be messy. DaisyUI adds component classes to Tailwind CSS. Classes like btn, card, etc‚Ä¶ No need to deal with hundreds of utility classes.
No script dependencies. 2KB gzipped. Worth a look.

One of the main challenges of evaluating Rust for use within the Android platform was ensuring we could provide sufficient interoperability with our existing codebase. If Rust is to meet its goals of improving security, stability, and quality Android-wide, we need to be able to use Rust anywhere in the codebase that native code is required.

              <summary>A little React library to replace your boring fallback avatars</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Boring avatars is a tiny JavaScript React library that generates custom, SVG-based, round avatars from any username and color palette.
Cool, but it‚Äôd be even cooler if it detached from React so we could all use it. It‚Äôd also be nice if you could opt to having the initials overlay the gradient.

                <p>Sometimes to solve a problem we tend to choose a set of tools we got used to. How often we pick a tool just because we know it, and not necessarily because it‚Äôs the right one for a task at hand? These are my rules to overcome that.

                <p>Firefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.
Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!
