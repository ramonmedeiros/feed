                    <span>The big story right now is the recently uncovered backdoor in liblzma (aka XZ) – a relatively obscure compression library that happens to be a dependency of OpenSSH.
This incident is noteworthy for so many reasons: the exploit itself, how it was deployed, how it was found, what it says about our industry &amp; how the community reacted. Let’s dig in!

                    <span>This week Adam went solo — talking to Kyle Wiens, Founder and CEO at iFixit, about all things Right to Repair. They discussed the latest win here in the US with Oregon passing an electronics Right to Repair law to allow owners the right to get their stuff fixed anywhere as well as limit the anti-repair practices of parts pairing. They also discussed the history of the DMCA, the challenges posed by Section 1201, the challenges of recycling products with glued-in batteries, the need for producer responsibility, the future of repairability, repair scoring systems to inform consumers, and so much more. Did you know that iFixit funds its advocacy work through the sale of its tools and parts? So cool.

We learn about how an ad-hoc group of software engineers worked with regulators, legislators &amp; policymakers to help drive some of the most impactful legislation curbing anti-competitive behaviors on the web for tech giants such as Apple, Google &amp; Microsoft via the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).
Tune in for this deeply important &amp; timely discussion as we also unpack recent events with Apple and their DMA (un)compliance, and how the OWA helped successfully organize thousands of web developers from around the world to hold ground for a free &amp; open web.

For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we&#x27;ve seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats they defend against. That’s why we&#x27;re excited to announce a new version of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection for people using the Standard protection mode of Safe Browsing in Chrome.

Working with our dedicated bug hunter community, we awarded $10 million to our 600+ researchers based in 68 countries. 


New Resources and Improvements


Just like every year, 2023 brought a series of changes and improvements to our vulnerability reward programs:



Through our new Bonus Awards program, we now periodically offer time-limited, extra rewards for reports to specific VRP targets.

                    <span>This week we’re talking about DNS with Paul Vixie — Paul is well known for his contributions to DNS and agrees with Adam on having a “love/hate relationship with DNS.” We discuss the limitations of current DNS technologies and the need for revisions to support future internet scale, the challenges in doing that. Paul shares insights on the future of the internet and how he’d reinvent DNS if given the opportunity. We even discuss the cultural idiom “It’s always DNS,” and the shift to using DNS resolvers like OpenDNS, Google’s 8.8.8.8 and Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1. Buckle up, this is a good one.
