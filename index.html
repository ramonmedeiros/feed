                    <span>This week we’re joined by On Freund, former VP of Engineering at WeWork and now co-founder &amp; CEO of Wilco. WeWork you may have heard of, but Wilco maybe not (yet).
We get into the details behind the tech and scaling of WeWork, comparisons of the fictional series on Apple TV+ called WeCrashed and how much of that is true. Then we move on to Wilco which is what has On’s full attention right now. Wilco has the potential to be the next big thing for developers to acquire new skills. Wilco aims to be the ultimate simulator to gain new skills on a real-life tech stack. If you want to skip ahead, you can request access at trywilco.com/changelog — they are moving our listeners to the top of the waiting list.

                    <span>This looks very opinionated with the tech it chooses (Node, Express, MongoDB, React, TypeScript). But if you like those choices, that probably means you’ll like what they’ve cooked up.
Payload gives you everything you need, but then steps back and lets you build what you want in JavaScript or TypeScript - with no unnecessary complexity brought by GUIs. You’ll understand how your CMS works because you will have written it exactly how you want it.
Bring your own Express server and do whatever you need on top of Payload. Payload doesn’t impose anything on you or your app.
Completely control the Admin panel by using your own React components. Swap out fields or even entire views with ease.
Use your data however and wherever you need thanks to auto-generated, yet fully extensible REST, GraphQL, and Local Node APIs.

                    <span>User Uptrenda asked HN about their favorite data structures, sharing their own to get it started:
I’ll start: bloom filters. Lets you test if a value is definitely NOT in a list of pre-stored values (or POSSIBLY in a list - with adjustable probability that influences storage of the values.)
Good use-case: routing. Say you have a list of 1 million IPs that are black listed. A trivial algorithm would be to compare every element of the set with a given IP. The time complexity grows with the number of elements. Not so with a bloom filter! A bloom filter is one of the few data structures whose time complexity does not grow with the number of elements due to the ‘keys’ not needing to be stored (‘search’ and ‘insert’ is based on the number of hash functions.)
The responses are numerous with a lot of signal, which is increasingly rare on the orange website these days. Worth a read!

                    <span>Gerhard’s transition to a senior engineer started 10 years ago, when he embraced the vim mindset, functional core &amp; imperative shell, and was inspired to seek simplicity in his code &amp; infrastructure. Most of it can be traced back to one person: Gary Bernhardt, the creator of Execute Program, Destroy all Software and the now famous Wat idea.
Few stick around long enough to understand the long-term impact of their decisions on production systems. Even fewer are able to talk about them as well as Gary does.

                    <span>This article confirms my biases because I’ve always despised every soft delete implementation I’ve come up with. Most of them have looked something like what the author describes:
the technique has some major downsides. The first is that soft deletion logic bleeds out into all parts of your code. All our selects look something like this:
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE id &#x3D; @id
    AND deleted_at IS NULL;

And forgetting that extra predicate on deleted_at can have dangerous consequences as it accidentally returns data that’s no longer meant to be seen.
ORMs help with this, but not enough. You set it as a default scope and then there’s that one time where you also want the deleted records so you come up with a custom query or dig into your ORM and try to find how to bypass the rule. Yuck!
He goes on to describe other problems as well. Maybe it’s all a big case of YAGNI?
Once again, soft deletion is theoretically a hedge against accidental data loss. As a last argument against it, I’d ask you to consider, realistically, whether undeletion is something that’s ever actually done.
When I worked at Heroku, we used soft deletion.
When I worked at Stripe, we used soft deletion.
At my job right now, we use soft deletion.
As far as I’m aware, never once, in ten plus years, did anyone at any of these places ever actually use soft deletion to undelete something.

                    <span>Today on July 20 2022, curl turns exactly 8888 days old. It was born on March 20, 1998 when curl 4.0 was shipped. The number 8 is considered a lucky number in several Asian cultures and I figure we can view this as a prequel to the planned curl version 8 release we intend to … Continue reading curl is 8888 days old →</span>

                    <span>In this Fully-Connected episode, Daniel and Chris explore DALL-E 2, the amazing new model from Open AI that generates incredibly detailed novel images from text captions for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language.  Along the way, they acknowledge that some folks in the larger AI community are suggesting that sophisticated models may be approaching sentience, but together they pour cold water on that notion.  But they can’t seem to get away from DALL-E’s images of raccoons in space, and of course, who would want to?

                    <span>This week Adam is taking the show off the beaten path to speak with Adam Miller, the founder and CEO of Revel Bikes. Yes that’s right, this episode features a founder of a bike brand, not a tech brand.
Adam Miller’s journey to create Revel Bikes is paved with many ups and many downs, a failed partnership, super scrappy weeks and months traveling the world to find the best manufacturing partners, the latest innovations in suspension tech and modern geometry to hit the mountain biking scene, a strong team that’s been with him every step of the way (many of which are as close as family), and truly some of the best premium bikes available on the market today.

                    <span>Only 5% of Indie Hackers products make $100k/year…
A sobering statistic, but with a caveat: this only accounts for the 937 products that have their revenue verified by Stripe. The 5% is low, but that’s for a high bar of $100k/year. It gets worse:
A prevalent thinking is that making money as an indie developer is hard and most of the products end up with no revenue at all. Products on Indie Hackers seem to confirm this as more than 54% of the products are not making any revenue at all.
The post also breaks down the best performing product categories. ‘Wearables’ looks like a good one.
(We love the Indie Hackers community and know how hard it is to make it on your own. This post is not intended to denigrate anyone, just provide information.)

                    <span>Posted by Matthew Maurer and Mike Yu, Android team
   To help keep Android users’ DNS queries private, Android supports encrypted   DNS. In addition to existing support for DNS-over-TLS, Android now supports   DNS-over-HTTP/3 which has a number of improvements over DNS-over-TLS. 
  Most network connections begin with a DNS lookup. While transport security may   be applied to the connection itself, that DNS lookup has traditionally not   been private by default: the base DNS protocol is raw UDP with no encryption.   While the internet has migrated to TLS over time, DNS has a bootstrapping   problem. Certificate verification relies on the domain of the other party,   which requires either DNS itself, or moves the problem to DHCP (which may be   maliciously controlled).

                    <span>Matt Rickard, yes this Matt Rickard from episode #463 of The Changelog, shared some thoughts (an unordered list) about the forces acting on RSS.
He sets the stage by sharing a swath of think pieces written on the subject.
No technology other than RSS has had more think pieces written proclaiming the death of RSS (2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013) and the rebirth of RSS (2009, 2010, 2011, 2018, 2018, 2019).
Here are two points (of several shared) that stood out to me.
Substack has revitalized the blogging movement by giving away free hosting and email lists, and a business model for supporting writers. As email newsletters grow, RSS is a decent alternative to an increasingly cluttered email inbox.
Creator incentives work against RSS. The protocol does not benefit content creators because it doesn’t give them any insight into their audience (number of subscribers, emails, or other data).
What are your thoughts in his thoughts? What’s next for RSS?

                    <span>This isn’t the first attempt at making regular expressions more approachable, but it’s the first one I’ve seen that also brings type safety to the table. Example code:
import { createRegExp, exactly, oneOrMore, digit } from &#x27;magic-regexp&#x27;

// Quick-and-dirty semver
createRegExp(
  oneOrMore(digit)
    .as(&#x27;major&#x27;)
    .and(&#x27;.&#x27;)
    .and(oneOrMore(digit).as(&#x27;minor&#x27;))
    .and(exactly(&#x27;.&#x27;).and(oneOrMore(char).as(&#x27;patch&#x27;)).optionally())
)

                    <span>Testing distributed systems under hard failures like network partitions and instance termination is critical, but it’s also important we test them under less catastrophic conditions because this is what they most often experience. Comcast is a tool designed to simulate common network problems like latency, bandwidth restrictions, and dropped/reordered/corrupted packets.
It works by wrapping up some system tools in a portable(ish) way. On BSD-derived systems such as OSX, we use tools like ipfw and pfctl to inject failure. On Linux, we use iptables and tc. Comcast is merely a thin wrapper around these controls.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Daniel Thompson about Tauri and their journey to their recent 1.0 release. Tauri is often compared to Electron - it’s a toolkit that lets you build software for all major desktop operating systems using web technologies. It was built for the security-focused, privacy-respecting, and environmentally-conscious software engineering community. The core libraries are written in Rust and the UI layer can be written using virtually any frontend framework. We get into all the details, why Rust, how the project was formed, their resistance (thus far) to venture capital, their full commitment to the freedom virtues of open source, and all the technical bits you need to know to consider it for your next multi-platform project.

                    <span>Scanners Box also known as scanbox, is a powerful hacker toolkit, which has collected more than 10 categories of open source scanners from Github, including subdomain, database, middleware and other modular design scanner etc. But for other Well-known scanning tools, such as nmap, w3af, brakeman, arachni, nikto, metasploit, aircrack-ng will not be included in the scope of collection.
Toolkit might be a bit misleading. I was imagning some kind of Docker container or Linux distro with all the tools baked in. This is more of a collection of tools (which is why we applied the Awesome topic to it) that you can pick and choose from. Nice collection, though!

                    <span>Matija Sosic (Co-founder &amp; CEO at Wasp) shares what he thinks programming is going to look like in the near future.
When thinking about how ML code generation affects the overall development process, there is one thing to consider that often doesn’t immediately spring to mind when looking at the impressive Copilot examples. The question is - what happens with the code once it is generated? Who is responsible for it and who will maintain and refactor it in the future?
Although ML code generation helps with getting the initial code written, it cannot do much beyond that - if that code is to be maintained and changed in the future … the developer still needs to fully own and understand it.
Generated code accepted blindly is creating tech debt!
In other words, it means Copilot and similar solutions do not reduce the code complexity nor the amount of knowledge required to build features, they just help write the initial code faster, and bring the knowledge/examples closer to the code (which is really helpful). If a developer accepts the generated code blindly, they are just creating tech debt and pushing it forward.

This year marks 15 years since FizzBuzz was popularised as an interview tool for developers. I’m a big fan and have watched over 100 candidates try their hand at my version of the task. In today’s blog post I’d like to take a moment to celebrate what makes FizzBuzz so helpful, discuss some common patterns I’ve observed in the many attempts I’ve witnessed, and finally explore some tweaks that can be deployed to keep the challenge fresh.
Tom’s version of FizzBuzz is a pair programming task that follows strict TDD:
In proper pair programming style, the candidate is encouraged to discuss their approach with the interviewer. Likewise, they are free to use any online reference materials if they forget a method name or some syntax.
In this post he shares 3 common variants of the challenge including one that requires a pair of Azure Functions?!

One of the interesting things about the design of Caddy is that its core is just configuration management. It pushes out all other functionality into modules so that basically the only thing left in core is accepting and reacting to configuration changes.

                    <span>Aaron Francis:
The goal is not to become famous, the goal is to increase the chances of luck finding us. For me, one of the most helpful ways to think about this has always been the concept of the “Luck Surface Area,” described in an old post by Jason Roberts. He wrote (and note, the emphasis is mine):
The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you’re passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.
Going further, he codifies it into a formula where:
Luck &#x3D; [Doing Things] * [Telling People]
This reminds me a bit of John Gruber’s Obsession Times Voice. Not exactly the same, but there’s a healthy overlap that I find provocative.

My 33rd anniversary in the software industry was the Sunday that just passed, July 3. I remember the date because my second day on the job was a paid holiday!
I want to show you just how far our industry has come and how much we’ve learned.
The more things change:
Lots of things we all take for granted didn’t exist. The Internet existed but not the Web. Software was delivered to customers on tapes or floppy disks. The CD burner was still a few years in the future. Java didn’t exist, JavaScript didn’t exist, .NET didn’t exist.
The more they stay the same:
There was a holy war over text editors. IDEs weren’t a thing yet, so we all coded in a text editor. I was firmly in the Emacs camp, but most of my co-workers loved vi.

                    <span>Nick Nisi shared this with me recently and it’s cool, so I thought I’d pass it along. Here’s Nick describing it:
And it is a visual wrapper around jq, that kind of does the fzf type thing where as you’re writing out your query, it’s live showing you a preview in virtual text of exactly what would get returned by what you’re querying as you go. So you can use that as a nice tool to build out your jq syntax, or your jq query, and in real time get that feedback.
The only bummer is that it’s written in Ruby. Don’t get me wrong, I love Ruby. But it requires you to have Ruby tooling on your machine to use jqq, which many people don’t have or want. BUT it’s a mere 241 lines of code, so porting it to something a little more portable shouldn’t be too much work…

Instead of storing your passwords in a vault it derives your password on the fly from your master password and supplied realm string (for example, resource URL).
How cool is that?! Here’s an example use:
gokey -p super-secret-master-password -r example.com

Why let JS have all the fun? With mix-blend-mode finally gaining wide browser-support, we now have access to many of most common shading techniques in CSS. With some choice images and a bit of careful layering it’s possible to build some surprisingly high-quality effects without the need for introducing any JS dependencies.
If you’ve ever used Photoshop’s Blend Modes… you can basically do that in CSS now. So cool! Check out Robb’s entire article. He includes a lot of great examples.

We deleted the K8s cluster and moved wildcard cert management to Fastly &amp; all our vanity domain certs to Fly.io. We migrated the Docker Engine that our GitHub Actions is using - PR #416 has all the details. We did a few other things in preparation for our secrets plan.

                    <span>Lockdown Mode is the first major capability of its kind designed to offer an extreme, optional protection for the very small number of users who face grave, targeted threats to their digital security.
It blocks non-image attachment types in Messages, disables JIT compilation in Safari, blocks incoming FaceTime calls from unknown senders, won’t let the phone connect to a computer via a wired connection, and disables the ability to install new configuration profiles.

The way that I run my Developer Relations team focuses on three different things:
Education 🧑‍🏫
Community 🤝
Product 🎁
But first, a caveat
The way DevRel teams or organizations are structured at companies kind of depends on where it falls in that company’s priorities. So for a developer tooling company where their bread and butter is talking to developers, it’s probably gonna have an elevated position in the company. It’s incredibly important to their business and to their co…</span>

                    <span>Philip Walton:
While most teams I talk to would love to be able to run A/B tests to accurately assess the performance impact of certain changes, the problem is pretty much every popular A/B testing tool on the market has such a negative impact on load performance that they’re essentially unusable for this purpose.
If you’re just trying to determine which of two marketing headlines converts better, then perhaps this performance difference isn’t so bad. But if you’re wanting to run an A/B test to determine whether inlining your CSS in the 
 of your pages will improve your FCP, well, those popular A/B testing tools are just not going to cut it.
He goes on to describe his process for running performant A/B tests on his static site using Cloudflare workers to swap in/out his experiments.

That’s why I decided to implement it myself. It provides a toast component, which is linked to a particular component on a page, which enables developers to provide located feedback (instead of page-wise feedback which you can provide with normal toast)

                    <span>Over the last year, we’ve seen artificial intelligence (AI) systems advance our work in areas like inclusive product development and support for small businesses and job seekers. We’ve also seen its potential to be helpful in addressing major global needs — like forecasting and planning humanitarian responses to natural disasters, addressing global environmental challenges, and delivering groundbreaking scientific research.


AI is exciting — both from a technical perspective and when considering its underlying social benefits. And yet, to fully realize AI’s potential, it must be developed responsibly, thoughtfully and in a way that gives deep consideration to core ethical questions. After all, the promise of great reward inherently involves risk — and we’re committed to ethically developi…</span>

CPython 3.11 is on average 25% faster than CPython 3.10 when measured with the pyperformance benchmark suite, and compiled with GCC on Ubuntu Linux. Depending on your workload, the speedup could be up to 10-60% faster.

                    <span>Bundle, transpile, install and run JavaScript &amp; TypeScript projects — all in Bun. Bun is a new JavaScript runtime with a native bundler, transpiler, task runner and npm client built-in.
Bun is competing with Node and Deno, with the following goals:
Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).
I like those goals, and it’s designed to be a drop-in replacement for your current runtime.

You don’t need to look far on web dev social media to find somebody lecturing everybody and nobody about how you should do web development. Hell, I’ve been guilty of that myself.
You should use this or that framework.
Or, you should not use this or that framework and instead use a cognitive framework like Model-View-Controller with ‘vanilla’ web components.
No, no, no Functional Reactive is where it’s at.
You should be writing code test-first and unit test everything.
Or, you should go light on the unit tests and focus instead on integration tests.
Or, end-to-end tests. Just test the shit out of the actual running app.
Or, you should use this different kind of unit test which doesn’t look anything like that other kind of unit test.
Those aren’t integration tests! This is an integration test! What’s wrong with you?!
Sound familiar? Unfortunately, you don’t get to be a “famous” social media influencer by posting reasoned, nuanced takes that end with something like: “I dunno, this works for me but it may not for you. It depends…”

It feels bizarre saying this, having spent so much of my life advocating for and selling a distribution of Kubernetes and consulting services to help folks get the most of out it, but here goes! YOU probably shouldn’t use Kubernetes and a bunch of other “cool” things for your product.
This post turns out to be less about Kubernetes and more about premature optimization and doing more with less. Also it’s about Kubernetes. 😉

He was on the podcast five years ago discussing the surprise success of Prettier, an opinionated code formatter that’s still in use to this day. This time around we’re going deep on Actual, his personal finance system James built as a business for over 4 years before recently opening it up and making it 100% free.
Has James given up on the business? Or will this move Actual(ly) breathe new life into a piece of software that’s used and beloved by many? Tune in to find out.

                    <span>After many years of gradual improvement Vim now takes a big step with a major release. Besides many small additions the spotlight is on a new incarnation of the Vim script language: Vim9 script.
One of Neovim’s major draws is that you can avoid Vim script altogether and use Lua instead. It looks like the Vim team is addressing the two major complaints folks have with Vim script: performance and its obscure syntax:
The main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.
A secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer to commonly used programming languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript and Java.
Legacy scripts will continue to work, of course. The Vim team has no plans to drop legacy support in the foreseeable future. Learn more about Vim9 script here or with :help vim9 inside Vim itself.

                    <span>Five years ago, information designer Mahima Pushkarna joined Google to make data easier to understand. As a senior interaction designer on the People + AI Research (PAIR) team, she designed Data Cards to help everyone better understand the contexts of the data they are using. The Data Cards Playbook puts Google’s AI Principles into practice by providing opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations and appeal.
Recently, Mahima’s paper on Data Cards (co-written with Googlers Andrew Zaldivar and Oddur Kjartansson) was accepted to the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (ACM FAccT). Let’s catch up with her and find out more about what brought her to Google.

                    <span>Natural language processing (NLP) is a form of artificial intelligence that teaches computer programs how to take in, interpret, and produce language from large data sets. For example, grammar checkers use NLP to come up with grammar suggestions that help people write grammatically correct phrases. But as Google’s AI Principles note, it’s sometimes necessary to have human intervention to identify risks of unfair bias.


Sunipa Dev is a research scientist at Google who focuses on Responsible AI. Some of her work focuses specifically on ways to evaluate unfair bias in NLP outcomes, reducing harms for people with queer and non-binary identities. Sunipa’s work was recently featured at a workshop at the ACM Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAcct) conference in Seoul, Korea.

                    <span>Ben Johnson, the creator of Litestream, joined Fly.io a few weeks after we migrated changelog.com - episode 50 has all the details. That was pure coincidence. What was not a coincidence, is Gerhard jumping at the opportunity to talk to Ben about Postgres vs SQLite with Litestream.
The prospect of running a cluster of our app instances spread across all regions, with local SQLite &amp; Litestream replication, is mind boggling. Let’s find out from Ben what will it take to get there.  Thanks Kürt for kicking off this dream.

                    <span>Miguel Grinberg built a SQLite-backed web app for the blogging team at Twilio to track their effectiveness that started to respond slugishly when it grew much bigger than he expected (6.5 million individual daily traffic records, and with a user base that grew to over 200 employees).
He thought this might be a good time to switch to Postgres, but he wasn’t sure if the wins he expected would be realized:
Having publicly professed my dislike of performance benchmarks, I resisted the urge to look up any comparisons online, and instead embarked on a series of experiments to accurately measure the performance of these two databases for the specific use cases of this application.
In this in-depth article on Twilio’s blog (no doubt being tracked by Miguel’s web app as we speak) he goes into the details of his efforts with lots of interesting findings along the way (even a plot twist!). I’ll leave you with this statement from the end:
If you are going to take one thing away from this article, I hope it is that the only benchmarks that are valuable are those that run on your own platform, with your own stack, with your own data, and with your own software. And even then, you may need to add custom optimizations to get the best performance.

It’s normal for candidates not to ask harder questions about our company, so they usually miss out on a chance to (i) de-risk our company’s performance and (ii) to increase the chances they’ll like working here.
Does the company have product-market fit? How much runway does the company have? Does their spending look within reason? What’s the culture like? And more tough questions that you really should be asking before accepting that offer.

The large amount of high dimensional biological data that is available today, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, creates unique opportunities to push the boundaries of what is possible in biology.
To that end, Immunai has built the largest immune database called AMICA that contains tens of millions of cells. The company uses cutting-edge transfer learning techniques to transfer knowledge across different cell types, studies, and even species.

                    <span>The P in PRQL (pronounced “Prequel”) stands for Pipelined, which I’m convinced is a great way of writing and reasoning about queries:
A PRQL query is a linear pipeline of transformations
Each line of the query is a transformation of the previous line’s result. This makes it easy to read, and simple to write.
It compiles to SQL, which means it’s compatible with most databases already and there are currently bindings for Python, JS &amp; Rust, which is the compiler itself.
Try it out in their web-based playground. (Thanks, Wasm!)

                    <span>This is a minimal implementation of DALL·E Mini.  It has been stripped to the bare essentials necessary for doing inference, and converted to PyTorch.  The only third party dependencies are torch for the torch model and flax for the flax model.
How much mini-er can it get from here? 🤔

The DevSecOps pipeline follows the familiar DevOps “infinity loop” structure while incorporating some extra steps to ensure code security before, during, and after it’s pushed to production.</span>

Why products should be “slick”, not just viable
I hate MVPs. So do your customers. Make it SLC instead.

                    <span>Brandon Rhodes’s solution to conflicts between his ~/bin scripts and system binaries: the humble comma
I heartily recommend this technique to anyone with their own ~/bin/ directory who wants their command names kept clean, tidy, and completely orthogonal to any commands that the future might bring to your system. The approach has worked for me for something like a decade, so you should find it immensely robust. And, finally, it’s just plain fun.
