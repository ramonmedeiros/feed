We take a more detailed look at our newest tool for finding vulnerabilities in these interfaces – snapshot fuzzing.

We explore the challenges and the advantages of semantic versioning (aka SemVer), the need for improving the tooling around SemVer, where semantic versioning really shines and where it’s needed, Types and SemVer, whether or not there’s a better way, and why it’s not as simple as just opting out.

                              <span>Today we’re proud to announce the next Mozilla Builders project: sqlite-vec. Led by independent developer Alex Garcia, this project brings vector search functionality to the beloved SQLite embedded database. Alex has been working on this problem for a while, and we think his latest approach will have a great impact by providing application developers with a powerful new tool for building Local AI applications.

                              <span>Can an attacker execute arbitrary commands on a remote server just by sending JSON? Yes, if the running code contains unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities. But how is that possible? In this blog post, we’ll describe how unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities work and how you can detect them in Ruby projects.

Neo4j – Is your code getting dragged down by JOINs and long query times? The problem might be your database…Try simplifying the complex with graphs. Stop asking relational databases to do more than they were made for. Graphs work well for use cases with lots of data connections like supply chain, fraud detection, real-time analytics, and genAI. With Neo4j, you can code in your favorite programming language and against any driver. Plus, it’s easy to integrate into your tech stack.
