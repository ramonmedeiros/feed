New AI innovations and applications are reaching consumers and businesses on an almost-daily basis. Building AI securely is a paramount concern, and we believe that Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) can help chart a path for creating AI applications that users can trust. Today, we’re highlighting two new ways to make information about AI supply chain security universally discoverable and verifiable, so that AI can be created and used responsibly. 





The first principle of SAIF is to ensure that the AI ecosystem has strong security foundations. In particular, the software supply chains for components specific to AI development, such as machine learning models, need to be secured against threats i…</span>

In September, we shared how we are implementing the voluntary AI commitments that we and others in industry made at the White House in July. One of the most important developments involves expanding our existing Bug Hunter Program to foster third-party discovery and reporting of issues and vulnerabilities specific to our AI systems. Today, we’re publishing more details on these new reward program elements for the first time. Last year we issued over $12 million in rewards to security researchers who tested our products for vulnerabilities, and we expect today’s announcement to fuel even greater collaboration for years to come.

Last week at Singapore International Cyber Week and the ETSI Security Conferences, the international community gathered together to discuss cybersecurity hot topics of the day. Amidst a number of important cybersecurity discussions, we want to highlight progress on connected device security demonstrated by  joint industry principles for IoT security transparency. The future of connected devices offers tremendous potential for innovation and quality of life improvements. Putting a spotlight on consumer IoT security is a key aspect of achieving these benefits. Marketplace competition can be an important driver of security improvements, with…</span>

When adding loops and conditionals, even simple code can become difficult to understand.
Consider this change:




if (commode.HasPreferredCustomer()) {

if (commode.HasPreferredCustomer()) {


  commode.WarmSeat();

  commode.WarmSeat();



} else if (commode.CustomerOnPhone()) {



  commode.ChillSeat();


}

}




While the above change may seem simple, even adding a single else statement can make the code harder to follow since the complexity of code grow…</span>

                    <span>It seems like everyone is interested in Rust these days. Even the most popular Python linter, Ruff, isn’t written in Python! It’s written in Rust. But what is the state of training or inferencing deep learning models in Rust? In this episode, we are joined by Nathaniel Simard, the creator burn. We discuss Rust in general, the need to have support for AI in multiple languages, and the current state of doing “AI things” in Rust.

                    <span>Listen to our Next Level album as a podcast! We grew up in the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. It’s no surprise that so many of our tracks are inspired by the 8-bit and 16-bit music of our youth. From Castlevania to Contra, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more — we were inspired by all the nostalgic soundtracks from the games that got us here, to give our pods one-of-a-kind vibes. If you’ve been head nodding to our beats during our shows and you’ve been wishing for a way to listen outside of our pods, then this release will be an absolute delight.
It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this on your next coding adventure or deep work session…

                    <span>It’s not that uncommon to have the mysterious Breakmaster Cylinder produce your podcast’s theme song. But it’s super uncommon to collaborate with BMC over the course of 7 years to produce fresh, custom beats for your entire podcast portfolio.
Theme songs, outros, ad music, ins, outs, stabs, robot noises, jingles… you name it and BMC has produced it for us. All with that signature glitchy goodness that BMC is known for. Eventually, we ended up with a deep catalog of tracks that only live on our podcasts or on our hard drives. Not anymore, baby!
We’re excited to announce the release of TWO full-length musical albums!

According to Data.ai, the pandemic accelerated existing mobile habits – with app categories like finance growing 25% year-over-year and users spending over 100 billion hours in shopping apps. It&#x27;s now even more important that data is protected so that bad actors can&#x27;t access the information.

We were holding S3 wrong, we put some cash back in our pockets, we enabled HTTP/3, Brotli compression, and Fastly websockets, we improved our SLOs, we improved Changelog Nightly, and we’re going to KubeCon 2023 in Chicago.

Shell scripts (including Bash scripts) can be convenient for automating simple command line procedures, and they are often better than keeping complicated commands in a single developer&#x27;s history. However, shell scripts can be hard to understand and maintain, and are typically not as well-supported as other programming languages. Shell scripts have less support for unit testing, and there is likely a lower chance that somebody reading one will be experienced with the language.

                    <span>This week we’re joined by Marcin Kulik to talk about his project asciinema. You’ve likely seen this out there in the wild — asciinema lets you record and share your terminal sessions in full fidelity. Forget screen recording apps that offer blurry video. asciinema provides a lightweight, text-based approach to terminal recording with lots of possibilities. Marcin shares the backstory on this project, where he’d like to take it, who’s supporting him along the way, and we even included 11 minutes of bonus content for Changelog ++ subscribers.

In July 2023, four Googlers from the Enterprise Security and Access Security organizations developed a tool that aimed at revolutionizing the way Googlers interact with Access Control Lists - SpeakACL. This tool, awarded the Gold Prize during Google’s internal Security &amp; AI Hackathon, allows developers to create or modify security policies using simple English instructions rather than having to learn system-specific syntax or complex security principles.

                    <span>Posted by Andrew Walbran, Android Rust Team


moving native code in Android from C++ to Rust has resulted in fewer security vulnerabilities. Most of the components we mentioned then were system services in userspace (running under Linux), but these are not the only components typically written in memory-unsafe languages. Many security-critical components of an Android system run in a “bare-metal” environment, outside of the Linux kernel, and these are historically written in C. As part of our efforts to harden firmware on Android devices, we are increasingly using Rust in these bare-metal environments too.


To that end, we have rewritten the Android Virtualization Framework’s protected VM (pVM) firmware in Rust to provide a memory safe foundation for the pVM root of trust. This firmware p…</span>

                    <span>Stephen Roettger and Marios Pomonis, Google Software Engineers


In 2020, we launched a novel format for our vulnerability reward program (VRP) with the kCTF VRP and its continuation kernelCTF. For the first time, security researchers could get bounties for n-day exploits even if they didn’t find the vulnerability themselves. This format proved valuable in improving our understanding of the most widely exploited parts of the linux kernel. Its success motivated us to expand it to new areas and we&#x27;re now excited to announce that we&#x27;re extending it to two new targets: v8CTF and kvmCTF.





Today, we&#x27;re launching v8CTF, a CTF focused on V8, the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome. kvmCTF is an upcoming CTF focused on Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) that will be released later in the year.…</span>

He even surprises us with his idea of creating a web browser.

                    <span>What is the model lifecycle like for experimenting with and then deploying generative AI models? Although there are some similarities, this lifecycle differs somewhat from previous data science practices in that models are typically not trained from scratch (or even fine-tuned). Chris and Daniel give a high level overview in this effort and discuss model optimization and serving.
