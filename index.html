                    <span>This project provides a tiny .emacs file to set up Emacs quickly. This document provides a detailed description of how to set it up and get started with Emacs.
Further this project also provides a tiny convenience command named em to start Emacs server and edit files using Emacs server. This helps in using Emacs efficiently.

                    <span>Previously, we compiled a Go program into a WebAssembly and then converted it into C++ files to make it run on Nintendo Switch. Now, I have succeeded in compiling a Go program into a native binary for Nintendo Switch, and also running a game there. I replaced system calls with C function calls using the -overlay option.

                    <span>Oliver Brotchie developed this CSS fingerprinting technique that requires no Javascript or Cookies to function and avoids anti-tracking methods such as NoScript, VPNs or browser extensions.
CSS Fingerprinting is a technique of tracking and gathering information on site visitors. This method exploits the nature of CSS to track various characteristics about the visitor’s browser and device, which can later be used to either identify or track said visitor.
Right now, at current spec, this method doesn’t scale, but with the next upcoming draft of the CSS specification, CSS Values 4, it will become far more scalable and precise.

                    <span>If you ever get into an “oh snap!” situation where you think you just lost days of work, checkout a dura branch and recover.
Without dura, you use Ctrl-Z in your editor to get back to a good state. That’s so 2021. Computers crash and Ctrl-Z only works on files independently. Dura snapshots changes across the entire repository as-you-go, so you can revert to “4 hours ago” instead of “hit Ctrl-Z like 40 times or whatever”. Finally, some sanity.
This sounds a lot like how Fossil works out of the box, except maybe even more paranoid because Fossil will propagate every commit whereas Dura propagates all changes even before they’re committed.

This looks like a fine open source alternative. I’ll give it a try and report back.

                    <span>RSS-Bridge is a PHP project capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don’t have one. It can be used on webservers or as a stand-alone application in CLI mode.
I made a very poor-man’s version of this as my first ever Sinatra app way back in the day. It’s cool to see that vision live on, but it sucks that tools like this have to exist. It seems that the author agrees with me on that:
We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have your service with your applications using your API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.
We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

                    <span>OpenDrop is a command-line tool that allows sharing files between devices directly over Wi-Fi. Its unique feature is that it is protocol-compatible with Apple AirDrop which allows to share files with Apple devices running iOS and macOS.
Super cool, but with a disclaimer: this is the result of reverse engineering the transfer protocol, so the odds of it being flakey (especially as Apple ships OS updates) are high. It’d be rad if Apple would publish an AirDrop-compatible specification for the community to rally around.
You know, like they did with FaceTime. 😉

Despite ongoing global challenges, we’ve made significant progress in our effort to build a fully error-corrected quantum computer, working towards our next hardware milestone of building an error-corrected quantum bit (qubit) prototype. At the same time, we have continued our commitment to realizing the potential of quantum computers in various applications. That&#x27;s why we published results in top journals, collaborated with researchers across academia and industry, and expanded our team to bring on new talent and expertise.

When Sara isn’t offering keynote speeches at conferences (she’s done so a dozen times) she’s writing books like “Codrops CSS Reference” and “Smashing Book 5.” Currently, she’s working on a new course, &quot;Practical Accessibility,&quot; meant to teach devs and designers ways to make their products accessible. In 2015, Sara was voted Developer of the Year in the net awards, and shortlisted for the Outstanding Contribution of the Year award. She also won an O’Reilly Web Platform Award for “exceptional leadership, creativity, and collaboration in the development of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the supporting Web ecosystem.”
We chatted with Sara about front-end web development, the importance of design and her appreciation of birds.

                    <span>In the summer, Dr. Gino Caspari’s day starts at 5:30 a.m. in Siberia, where he studies the ancient Scythians with the Swiss National Science Foundation. There, he looks for burial places of these nomadic warriors who rode through Asia 2,500 years ago. The work isn’t easy, from dealing with extreme temperatures, to swamps covered with mosquitos. But the biggest challenge is staying one step ahead of tomb raiders.
It’s believed that more than 90% of the tombs — called kurgans — have already been destroyed by raiders looking to profit off what they find, but Gino is looking for the thousands he believes remain scattered across Russia, Mongolia and Western China. To track his progress, he began mapping these burial sites using Google Earth. “There’s a plethora of open data sources out there, b…</span>

                    <span>This is the first (of probably many) “playing with generics” post we’ll see now that Go 1.18 is in beta with official support for the controversial feature.
This post aims to describe my initial experience converting my markphelps/optional library from using code generation to using generics instead. Hopefully, after reading this post you’ll have a better understanding of what generics can do for you and what they can’t.
Mark shares lots of good tips along the way. His findings are quite positive:
I ❤️ that I was able to delete 95% of my code because of generics.
I think that generics will be very beneficial to maintainers who create libraries for things like my own as well as for searching, sorting, transformations, and the like. I can also see some them being extremely helpful for creating well-tested libraries around the various concurrency patterns that are sometimes tricky to get right.

                    <span>Arnold Galovics:
Microservices are getting natural and we almost feel like we’ve been always living in the world of microservices. Lately when I talked to other developers and asked how they would start a greenfield project, almost certainly the answer was, well, one microservice for this, another one for this, another one for user management, one more for authentication, another for authorization, one more for session management, and the list could go on.
I’m gonna try to shed some light on what nobody is talking about when it comes to microservices. And yeah, it’s gonna be a first-hand experience from a past projects I worked on.
This excellent piece gave me some serious deja vu of [Kelsey Hightower’s monoliths are the future. I’m quite looking forward to Arnold’s upcoming “chapter 2” of the story.

                    <span>Turns out the pass command on your local Linux box can be used for a bunch of encryption-related things in addition to what most of us use it for: managing a user’s password.
One cool example is you can hide API keys from shoulder surfers (and history’s memory) by storing the key encrypted on disk and using pass to access it at runtime:
curl -H &quot;API-Key: $(pass provider/api_key)&quot; ...

Today they all get together to talk about about what it takes to build a platform team, why Team Topologies is a good conversation starter and why a curated blend of off-the-shelf, composed, and self-created services are required in any organisation operating at scale.
Your hunch is right, all of them used to share the same Pivotal London office with Tammer Saleh, our guest from episode 31. Chris used to win all table tennis matches without even breaking a sweat, and today Gerhard gets his comeback. Touché!

                    <span>A post from back in June resurfaced this week in light of the big Rails 7 release.
I learned to code in the JavaScript stack and am building a JavaScript based product. I never questioned this stack: many companies default to it, JS everywhere seems good, and the community is big. But for my new side project I decided to try Rails because despite some perception that Ruby on Rails is ‘over’, people in HN comments say it was somehow more enjoyable than the newer Node based stack. Having tried it I can say wow - coming from the current Javascript ecosystem makes discovering Rails a revelation.
If you make your technology choices because of “perception that $TECHNOLOGY is ‘over’”, you are missing out on a world of potentially great options.

More than 35,000 Java packages, amounting to over 8% of the Maven Central repository (the most significant Java package repository), have been impacted by the recently disclosed log4j vulnerabilities (1, 2), with widespread fallout across the software industry. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform remote code execution by exploiting the insecure JNDI lookups feature exposed by the logging library log4j. This exploitable feature was enabled by default in many versions of the library.


This vulnerability has captivated the information security ecosystem since its disclosure on December 9th because of both its severity and widespread impact. As a popular logging tool, log4j is used by tens of thousands of s…</span>

                    <span>DHH announcing the 7th major release of Ruby on Rails:
This version of Rails has been years in the conceptual making. It’s the fulfillment of a vision to present a truly full-stack approach to web development that tackles both the front- and back-end challenges with equal vigor. An omakase menu that includes everything from the aperitif to the dessert.
There’s a lot to like about the new Node-free approach to the frontend, at-work encryption added to Active Record, a new auto-loading strategy, and more. Congrats to the hundreds of contributors who worked on this major milestone!

                    <span>Julia Evans has a cool new web tool for experimenting with DNS. She wrote up why she created it and some of the tech behind the tool on her announcement post:
Mess With DNS gives you a real subdomain, and it’s running a real DNS server (the address is mess-with-dns1.wizardzines.com). The interesting thing about DNS is that it’s a global system with many different computers interacting, and so I wanted people to be able to actually see that system in action.

The discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability has set the internet on fire. Similar to shellshock and heartbleed, Log4Shell is just the latest catastrophic vulnerability in software that runs the internet. Our mission as the Google Open Source Security Team is to secure the open source libraries the world depends on, such as Log4j. One of our capabilities in this space is OSS-Fuzz, a free fuzzing service that is used by over 500 critical open source projects and has found more than 7,000 vulnerabilities in its lifetime. 
We want to empower open source developers to secure their code on their own. Over the next year we will work on better automated detection of non-memory corruption vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell. We have star…</span>

                    <span>Russ Cox, for the Go team:
Generics are the most significant change to Go since the release of Go 1, and certainly the largest single language change we’ve ever made. With any large, new feature, it is common for new users to discover new bugs, and we don’t expect generics to be an exception to this rule; be sure to approach them with appropriate caution.
It didn’t make the headline, but fuzzing (tests that automatically find inputs which cause your program to crash or return invalid answers) also made it in the build, which our Go Time team has been quite excited about as well.

                    <span>The Supabase folks have open sourced a work-in-progress native PostgreSQL extension adding GraphQL support. First, they surveyed the field and liked what they saw from Graphile and Hasura, but…
we host free-tier projects on VMs with 1 GB of memory. After tallying the resources reserved for PostgreSQL, PostgREST, Kong, GoTrue, and a handful of smaller services, we were left with a total memory budget of … 0 MB 😬. Unsurprisingly, our pathological memory target disqualified any option that required launching another process in those VMs.
By their estimates, this effort will reduces the platform’s memory requirements by 525 TB/hours every month. Seems worth it!

The external security researcher community plays an integral role in making the Google Play ecosystem safe and secure. Through this partnership with the community, Google has been able to collaborate with third-party developers to fix thousands of security issues in Android applications before they are exploited and reward security researchers for their hard work and dedication.  
In order to empower the next generation of Android security researchers, Google has collaborated with industry partners including HackerOne and PayPal to host a number of Android App Hacking Workshops. These workshops are an effort designed to educate security researchers and cybersecurity students of all skill levels …</span>

                    <span>We will be working with other ECMA members and the wider JS community on the next iterations of JavaScript, in the TC39 working group. We will be pushing for features and improvements to the language that benefit everyone, but especially users of server-side JavaScript.
Specific features they plan to push forward are better support for non-JS assets in the ES module graph, better support for explicit resource management, and more extensive standard library functions for async iteration. Oh, and this:
As TypeScript is a core part of the Deno ecosystem, we are also very interested in pushing for even closer alignment of TypeScript and JavaScript in the future.

I’m a developer and I love to write code. I enjoy watching my brain come up with creative solutions for complex problems.
So, I often find myself with a blog post that’s ready to be submitted to Hacker News, or a tweet that’s ready to be sent, but postponing it.
Sound familiar? If so, read the story to learn how he got over it and started benefiting from his new-found confidence.

                    <span>A rebuttal by Kailash Nadh to the aforelinked post.
large for-profit corporations started their widespread consumption of FOSS, ever since countless “unicorns” raised infinite amounts of funding on valuations built pretty much entirely on FOSS, ever since FOSS got co-opted into corporatisation and capitalisation. And yet, countless maintainers of critical and widely used FOSS struggle to make a living.
Whose fault is this? I do not believe that this is FOSS’ fault as a conceptual framework or a system. If FOSS was broken, the internet as we know it today wouldn’t exist; the countless marvels of technology that we take for granted and techno-economies that thrive on them wouldn’t exist; millions of software developers (like me) who learnt to write code with FOSS and learnt to make a living with that knowledge wouldn’t exist.

                    <span>The post-log4j-zero-day thinkpieces started rolling in over the weekend. I’m happy about that. We need to discuss this stuff. Here’s what Christine Dodrill’s TL;DR:
If you want me to make you useful software, pay me. If you use software made by others in their spare time and find it useful, pay them. This should not be a controversial opinion. This should not be a new thing. This should already be the state of the world and it is amazingly horrible for us to have the people that make the things that make our software work at all starve and beg for donations.
The entire article is worth considering.

                    <span>Check out the original RFC to find the genesis of this effort. Here’s the opening pitch:
We know there are huge costs and risks in introducing a new main language in the kernel. We risk dividing efforts and we increase the knowledge required to contribute to some parts of the kernel.
Most importantly, any new language introduced means any module written in that language will be way harder to replace later on if the support for the new language gets dropped.
Nevertheless, we believe that, even today, the advantages of using Rust outweighs the cost. We will explain why in the following sections.
Godspeed to everyone collaborating on what will surely be a massive, years-long undertaking.

But as the meeting went on, a series of perplexing questions began to be raised:
“How did the new engineer have access to break this in the first place?”
“What about our testing standards… How did they not catch this?”
“Actually, the change shouldn’t have impacted this service!”
“Luckily we were able to roll back quickly thanks to the instrumentation so-and-so wrote.”
“Well so-and-so left last year, do other services have the same instrumentation?”
“Wait! How are these 2 services even related?”
“I’m not sure, so-and-so wrote this doc. It seems outdated and they’re no longer with this org.”

My version updates the original package with maintained versions of packages, adds support for Rollup, esbuild and Browserify, brings support for node: protocol, and much more.

                    <span>In the quest to explore language models and develop new ones, we trained a series of transformer language models of different sizes, ranging from 44 million parameters to 280 billion parameters.
Our research investigated the strengths and weaknesses of those different-sized models, highlighting areas where increasing the scale of a model continues to boost performance – for example, in areas like reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language. We also surface results where model scale does not significantly improve results — for instance, in logical reasoning and common-sense tasks.
Sometimes size matters, sometimes it doesn’t as much. Fascinating analysis.

                    <span>Human rights defenders need information from many sources to do their work effectively. But as issues evolve and new precedents are set, finding the right information to defend a particular case can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.
For example, a human rights advocate campaigning for LGBTQ rights may want to know which countries have made the most progress and what resolutions they’ve passed. To do so, they have to manually sift through thousands of pages of dense documentation covering global laws and victims’ testimonies to find what they’re looking for.
The curation and cataloging of documents makes this process much easier, but still relies on the manual work of skilled experts. To help, the non-profit organization HURIDOCS looked to machine learning. With support from Googl…</span>

Tammer and the SuperOrbital team are deeply experienced in this topic, and they help teams at companies like Bloomberg, Shopify, and federal U.S. agencies tackle hard Kubernetes and DevOps problems through engineering and training.
Why do companies need Kubernetes in the first place? Which are the right reasons for choosing it? Is Kubernetes a platform? Gerhard’s favourite: we are doing Kubernetes wrong, but it works better than when we were doing it right, so what’s up with th…</span>

                    <span>When you start Vim with the --clean option, it shows up in “vanilla” mode. No plugins, no configuration, just back to the roots. I have collected a ton of configuration statements over the years, some of them dating from MS-DOS or Windows 3.1. Here is the deal: I will start from scratch to find a good starting-point configuration with just the plugins available in Fedora 35. Will I survive a week of coding? I’ll find out!

                    <span>An excellent analysis of the age-old dependency management problem:
At this point, I hope the tension is pretty clear: on the one hand, it’s great to keep components small, simple, and composable. On the other hand, it’s terrible to bury yourself in a tangle of different packages, no matter how tiny they are. The Unix philosophy and killing your dependencies pull in opposite directions.
But the author doesn’t stop there. They also offer a potential solution, which shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone, requires a compromise.

Well, one of the creators of Flower, Daniel Beutel, agreed to join us on the show to discuss the project (and federated learning more broadly)! The result is a really interesting and motivating discussion of ML, privacy, distributed training, and open source AI.

                    <span>Mitchell Hashimoto is partaking in Advent of Code this year and he’s added an extra facet to the challenge: implementing each solution with a single SQL statement.
I’m not an expert at SQL (or PostgreSQL) by any means. One of the reasons I decided to use SQL was to regain some proficiency while also learning some new concepts. I expect that many of my solutions are suboptimal and there are likely much better ways (by various definitions) to reach the same answer. I’d love to hear about those (make an issue) but I won’t be merging any changes since this represents my approach.
Sounds like a fun challenge! But how does he find the time? By timeboxing each problem to just 30 minutes.

                    <span>When your productivity takes a nosedive, it adds stress and anxiety, as you don’t have enough time to accomplish your goals and do what really matters to you. Understanding why your productivity is flailing will help you get back on track.
The idea is simple: ask “why” 5 times, until you get to the root cause of your issue. It’s not dissimilar to a kid who exasperates their parents by continually repeating “why”… but the benefits can be transformative!
