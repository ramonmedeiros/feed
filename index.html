                    <span>This week on we’re joined by Emil Sjölander from Figma — talking about bringing Dev Mode to Figma. Dev Mode is their new workspace in Figma that’s designed to bring developers and design to the same tool.
The question they’re trying to answer is “How do you create a home for developers in a design tool?” We go way back to Emil’s startup that was acquired by Figma called Visly, how we iterated to here from 20 years ago (think PSD &gt; HTML days), what they did to build Dev Mode, what they’re doing around codegen, the popularity of design systems, and what it takes to go from zero to Dev Mode.

                    <span>Shopify recently released a Hugging Face space demonstrating very impressive results for replacing background scenes in product imagery. In this episode, we hear the backstory technical details about this work from Shopify’s Russ Maschmeyer. Along the way we discuss how to come up with clever AI solutions (without training your own model).

                    <span>This week we’re talking about Swift with Ben Cohen, the Swift Team Manager at Apple. We caught up with Ben while at KubeCon last week. Ben takes us into the world of Swift, from Apple Native apps on iOS and macOS, to the Swift Server Workgroup for developing and deploying server side applications, to the Swift extension for VS Code, Swift as a safe C/C++ successor language, Swift on Linux and Windows, and of course what The Browser Company’s Arc browser is doing to bring Arc to Windows.

                    <span>Event-driven systems may not be the go-to solution for everyone because of the challenges they can add. While the system reacting to events published in other parts of the system seem elegant, some of the complexities they bring can be challenging.  However, they do offer durability, autonomy &amp; flexibility.
In this episode, we’ll define event-driven architecture, discuss the problems it solves, challenges it poses &amp; potential solutions.

We discuss some of those stories along with the issues that they surface.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Cory Doctorow (this episode contains explicit language) about how we can get back to that “new good internet.” Cory’s new book The Internet Con offers a lens to this conversation about disenshittifying the internet through anti-trust laws, limits on corporate tweaking, regulating unconstrained capitalism, and all the ways enshittification is enabled. Cory also shares his experience recording his own audio book under the direction of Gabrielle de Cuir at Skyboat Media, and what’s to come from his next Science Fiction book The Lost Cause.

                    <span>Rob Pike says, “Simplicity is the art of hiding complexity.” If that’s true, what is simplicity in the context of writing software in Go? Is it even something we should strive for? Can software be too simple? Ian &amp; Kris discuss with return guest  sam boyer.

The App Defense Alliance (ADA), an industry-leading collaboration launched by Google in 2019 dedicated to ensuring the safety of the app ecosystem, is taking a major step forward. We are proud to announce that the App Defense Alliance is moving under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, with Meta, Microsoft, and Google as founding steering members.


This strategic migration represents a pivotal moment in the Alliance’s journey, signifying a shared commitment by the members to strengthen app security and related standards across ecosystems. This evolution of the App Defense Alliance will enable us to foster more collaborative implementation of industry standards for app security.

Two days later, a policy paper was issued by the U.K. government entitled The Bletchley Declaration by Countries Attending the AI Safety Summit, 1-2 November 2023.  It was signed by 29 countries, including the United States and China, the global leaders in AI research.
In this Fully Connected episode, Daniel and Chris parse the details and highlight key takeaways from these documents, especially the extensive and detailed executive order, which has the force of law in the United States.

Since 2018, Google has partnered with ARM and collaborated with many ecosystem partners (SoCs vendors, mobile phone OEMs, etc.) to develop Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) technology. We are now happy to share the growing adoption in the ecosystem. MTE is now available on some OEM devices (as noted in a recent blog post by Project Zero) with Android 14 as a developer option, enabling developers to use MTE to discover memory safety issues in their application easily. 
The biggest contributor to security vulnerabilities are memory safety related defects and Google has invested in a set of technologies to help mitigate memory safety risks. These include but are not limited to:

Do you ever read code and find it hard to understand? You may be experiencing cognitive load!
Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort required to complete a task. When reading code, you have to keep in mind information such as values of variables, conditional logic, loop indices, data structure state, and interface contracts. Cognitive load increases as code becomes more complex. People can typically hold up to 5–7 separate pieces of informat…</span>

Improving the interoperability of web services is an important and worthy goal. We believe that it should be easier for people to maintain and control their digital identities. And we appreciate that policymakers working on European Union digital certificate legislation, known as eIDAS, are working toward this goal. However, a specific part of the legislation, Article 45, hinders browsers’ ability to enforce certain security requirements on certificates, potentially holding back advances in web security for decades. We and many past and present leaders in the international web community have significant concerns about Article 45&#x27;s impact on security. 


We urge lawmakers to heed the calls of scientists and security experts to revise this part of the legislation rather than erode users’ privacy and security on the web.</span>

                    <span>Jean Yang’s research on programming languages at Carnegie Mellon led her to realize that APIs are the layer that makes or breaks quality software systems. Unfortunately, developers are underserved by tools for dealing with, securing &amp; understanding APIs.
That realization led her to found Akita Software, which led her to join Postman by way of acquisition. That move, at least in part, also led her to join us on this very podcast. We think you’re going to enjoy this interview, we sure did.
