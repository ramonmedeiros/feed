                    <span>To wrap up the year we’re talking about what’s breaking the internet, again. Yes, we’re talking about ChatGPT and we’re joined by our good friend Shawn “swyx” Wang. Between his writings on L-Space Diaries and his AI notes repo on GitHub, we had a lot to cover around the world of AI and what might be coming in 2023.
Also, we have one more show coming out before the end of the year — our 5th annual “State of the log” episode where Adam and Jerod look back at the year and talk through their favorite episodes of the year and feature voices from the community. So, stay tuned for that next week.

                    <span>On Wednesday, Stability AI announced it would allow artists to remove their work from the training dataset for an upcoming Stable Diffusion 3.0 release. The move comes as an artist advocacy group called Spawning tweeted that Stability AI would honor opt-out requests collected on its Have I Been Trained website. The details of how the plan will be implemented remain incomplete and unclear, however.
This seems like a step in the right direction, but it appears that artists will have to proactively register and manually flag matched images in the database. Ain’t nobody got time for that!

                    <span>Python’s magic methods - also known as dunder (double underscore) methods - can be used to implement a lot of cool things. Most of the time we use them for simple stuff, such as constructors (__init__), string representation (__str__, __repr__) or arithmetic operators (__add__/__mul__). There are however many more magic methods which you probably haven’t heard about and in this article we will explore all of them (even the hidden and undocumented).

These extensions are nearly as fast those written in C, with the added benefit of Rust’s memory safety features, easy access to thousands of 3rd party crates and packages on crates.io, all while maintaining a splendid developer experience.

                    <span>Eight months ago, in 🎧 episode 49, Alex Sims (Solutions Architect &amp; Senior Software Engineer at James &amp; James) shared with us his ambition to help migrate a monolithic PHP app running on AWS EC2 to a more modern architecture. The idea was some serverless, some EKS, and many incremental improvements.
So how did all of this work out in practice? How did the improved system cope with the Black Friday peak, as well as all the following Christmas orders? Thank you Alex for sharing with us your Ship It! inspired Kaizen story. It’s a wonderful Christmas present! 🎄🎁

                    <span>Tony Parker writing on Swift’s blog:
When Swift began life as an open source project, we wanted to open not just the language itself, but the ecosystem around it. Foundation has been instrumental in the success of decades of software and has been an integral part of the Swift developer experience from the beginning, and we knew it had to be included in the open source offering.
Historically, Apple’s open source efforts have varied in just how open they are when it comes to community. On that topic, this is an uplifting bit of prose:
Open source projects are at their best when the community of users can participate and become a community of developers. A new, open contribution process will be available to enable all developers to contribute new API to Foundation.
This new Foundation project is slated to launch on GitHub in 2023.

there should be a bunch of different:
publishing services, like Substack and Ghost
reading apps, like Gmail and Matter
community platforms, like Slack and Discord
and we should look for ways to make these reading, publishing, and community services all play nicely together. I’m calling this model “the unbundled web,” and I think RSS should be the primary method of interop.
Where do I sign up? 😉

                    <span>Setting up Rails for the first time with all the dependencies necessary can be daunting for beginners. Docked Rails attempts to flatten the onboarding curve by only requiring a working Docker installation in order to get started making a new Rails application, working with that application during development, and running a basic server. All based on pre-configured commands and dependencies living in a Docker image.
Getting started is as easy as:
docker volume create ruby-bundle-cache
alias rails&#x3D;&#x27;docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/rails -v ruby-bundle-cache:/bundle dhh37/rails&#x27;
alias rails-server&#x3D;&#x27;docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/rails -v ruby-bundle-cache:/bundle -p 3000:3000 dhh37/rails server -b 0.0.0.0&#x27;

He took a moment to write down a few things he learned while there. The bullet points follow, but you’ll have to visit his blog for all the details:
Write down everything
Give and accept: ownership, agency, and responsibility
Be transparent with a low level of shame

                    <span>I thouroughly enjoyed reading this. It’s interesting to think about the evolution of transport storage. To this day, the USB thumb drive has proved to be the long-term winner and something I personally use very often. Wanna install Debian or do a clean install of macOS? You’ll likely do it by creating a bootable USB thumb drive.
Before the invention of the thumb drive, computer users stored and transported their files using floppy disks. Developed by IBM in the 1960s, first 8-inch and later 5 ¼-inch and 3 ½-inch floppy disks replaced cassette tapes as the most practical portable storage media. Floppy disks were limited by their relatively small storage capacity—even double-sided, double-density disks could store only 1.44 MB of data. During the 1990s, as the size of files and software increased…
Would you be surprised to learn that the supposed inventor of the thumb drive is in jail right now in Singapore? But why?

                    <span>SQLite has few functions compared to other database management systems. SQLite authors see this as a feature rather than a problem, because SQLite has an extension mechanism in place.
There are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete, inconsistent and scattered across the internet. sqlean brings them together, neatly packaged into domain modules, documented, tested, and built for Linux, Windows and macOS.
Think of it like an extended standard library for SQLite.

                    <span>Stephan Schmidt warns: “We have invited complexity through the door. But it will not leave as easily.”
One way to simplify your stack and reduce the moving parts, speed up development, lower the risk and deliver more features in your startup is “Use Postgres for everything”. Postgres can replace - up to millions of users - many backend technologies, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Mongo and Redis among them.
He then goes on to list nine things you can use Postgres for that replace more specific solutions: fulltext search, geospatial queries, etc.

                    <span>How will large language models (LLMs) change the world?
No one knows. With such uncertainty, a good exercise is to look for historical analogies—to think about other technologies and ask what would happen if LLMs played out the same way.
I like to keep things concrete, so I’ll discuss the impact of LLMs on writing. But most of this would also apply to the impact of LLMs on other fields, as well as other AI technologies like AI art/music/video/code.
What follows are 13 examples of technological innovations that changed the world and description of how they affected they way people work. Here’s an example analogy of Feet and Segways:
First, there was walking. Then the Segway came to CHANGE THE NATURE OF HUMAN TRANSPORT. Twenty years later, there is still walking, plus occasionally low-key alternatives like electric scooters.
In this analogy, LLMs work fine but just aren’t worth the trouble in most cases and society doesn’t evolve to integrate them. Domain-specific LLMs are used for some applications, but we start to associate “general” LLMs with tourists and mall cops. George W. Bush falls off an LLM on vacation and everyone loses their minds.

We care deeply about privacy. We also know that trust is built by transparency. This blog, and the technical paper reference within, is an example of that commitment: we describe an important new Android privacy infrastructure called Private Compute Core (PCC). 
Some of our most exciting machine learning features use continuous sensing data — information from the microphone, camera, and screen. These features keep you safe, help you communicate, and facilitate stronger connections with people you care about. To unlock this new generation of innovative concepts, we built a specialized sandbox to privately process and protect this data.

This blog post details an exploit for CVE-2022-42703 (P0 issue 2351 - Fixed 5 September 2022), a bug Jann Horn found in the Linux kernel&#x27;s memory management (MM) subsystem that leads to a use-after-free on struct anon_vma. As the bug is very complex (I certainly struggle to understand it!), a future blog post will describe the bug in full. For the time being, the issue tracker entry, this LWN article explaining what an anon_vma is and the commit that introduced the bug are great resources in order to gain additional context.

Successfully triggering the underlying vulnerability causes folio-&gt;mapping to point to a freed anon_vma object. Calling madvise(..., MADV_PAGEOUT)can then be used to repeatedly trigger accesses to the freed anon_vma in foli…</span>

                    <span>OpenAI recently released a model for automatic speech recognition called Whisper. I decided to reimplement the inference of the model from scratch using C/C++. To achieve this I implemented a minimalistic tensor library in C and ported the high-level architecture of the model in C++. The entire code is less than 8000 lines of code and is contained in just 2 source files without any third-party dependencies.
State of the art voice recognition without any PyTorch baggage and it’s optimized to run on Apple Silicon!

                    <span>I had the honor of joining the fine folks at Elixir SF awhile back to talk all about how we’ve been podcasting on Elixir for a long time now. Tune in if you’re curious about such things and/or if you’d like to take a stroll down memory lane as I show old versions of our album art and play our intro music along the way.
The preso is average, but the Q&amp;A near the end is above average, if you ask me. OH! And also we got Zoom bombed twice, which was a first for me. Thankfully, it was also a last. So far, at least…

                    <span>Simon Willison is using this year’s Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn Rust.
He’s using Copilot to help him with syntax/snippets via comment-driven prompting. He’s using ChatGPT as a study partner by asking it questions about how to do things in Rust. Is it working?
So far I think this is working really well.
I feel like I’m beginning to get a good mental model of how Rust works, and a lot of the basic syntax is beginning to embed itself into my muscle memory.
The real test is going to be if I can first make it to day 25 (with no prior Advent of Code experience I don’t know how much the increasing difficulty level will interfere with my learning) and then if I can actually write a useful Rust program after that without any assistance from these AI models.
And honestly, the other big benefit here is that this is simply a lot of fun. I’m finding interacting with AIs in this way—as an actual exercise, not just to try them out—is deeply satisfying and intellectually stimulating.
This might be an early glimpse into the future of AI-assisted learning…

This GitHub version is by a 3rd-party, though, so they have a lot of API limitations to work around. It’s a cool service, but be prepared to see “Incomplete Data.

Our goal is to make security effortless for you while browsing the web, so that you can go about your day without having to worry about the links that you click on or the files that you download.

                    <span>This looks like an interesting framework for everything error-related. The core handles the usual tasks (wrapping errors, creating classes, etc.) and plugins offer more advanced use cases (serialization, CLI errors, logging, etc.).

Go frameworks exist, but none provides a feature set like frameworks from other languages. This won’t change soon.
You may think that it’s because the Go ecosystem is younger. But there is a more important factor. Go is built around the Unix Philosophy…

                    <span>Posted by Jeffrey Vander Stoep 
For more than a decade, memory safety vulnerabilities have consistently represented more than 65% of vulnerabilities across products, and across the industry. On Android, we’re now seeing something different - a significant drop in memory safety vulnerabilities and an associated drop in the severity of our vulnerabilities. 
  
Looking at vulnerabilities reported in the Android security bulletin, which includes critical/high severity vulnerabilities reported through our vulnerability rewards program (VRP) and vulnerabilities reported internally, we see that the number of memory safety vulnerabilities have dropped considerably over the past few years/releases. From 2019 to 2022 the annual number of memory safety vulnerabilities dropped from 223 down to 85.

                    <span>Burnout has reportedly reached a critical point in the software developer circle since the onset of the Covid-19 health crisis. A recent study by Haystack Analytics, a company specializing in productivity of engineers, found that 83% of software developers suffer from burnout. The main reasons given by the latter to explain this exhaustion are high workload (47%), process inefficiency (31%) and lack of clarity of objectives and targets (29%).

                    <span>Jake Lazaroff spent the last few months learning Tailwind with an open mind and he’s ready to share his opinion of the popular CSS framework:
Tailwind is commonly described as “utility classes”, but that’s a bit of an understatement. It’s essentially a small language you write in the class attributes of your HTML that compiles to a combination of CSS rules and selectors — an abstraction over CSS. But all abstractions leak, and Tailwind is very leaky.
When an abstraction leaks, it means you still have to be aware of (and sometimes deeply so) the underlying layer that’s being abstracted. In this case, Jake is saying that you still need to know CSS to use Tailwind and lays out a few scenarios in which this is the case.
This might be unfair to Tailwind. To my knowledge, the team has never promoted it as a CSS replacement. At its core, it really is just a set of class names that apply styles. But even after working with it for months, there’s still a mental translation layer between “Tailwind CSS” and “real CSS”.

                    <span>There are some big AI-related controversies swirling, and it’s time we talk about them. A lawsuit has been filed against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI related to Copilot code suggestions, and many people have been disturbed by the output of Meta AI’s Galactica model. Does Copilot violate open source licenses? Does Galactica output dangerous science-related content? In this episode, we dive into the controversies and risks, and we discuss the benefits of these technologies.

                    <span>Ruby 3.1 adds a new core class called Data to represent simple immutable value objects. The Data class helps define simple classes for value-alike objects that can be extended with custom methods.
While the Data class is not meant to be used directly, it can be used as a base class for creating custom value objects. The Data class is similar to Struct, but the key difference being that it is immutable.
In its heyday, most Rubyists wouldn’t touch immutability with a ten-foot pole. Times, they are a changin’…

There’s a lot of FUD out there, so hopefully this show gives you a lens into what’s really going on, and what to really expect. Maybe more so, how to keep your job or find a new job. We come to this topic with great compassion and great understanding, so please…there is a community here for you. There’s a lot of people in our Slack.

I hesitated writing this post, because I don’t want to start, or get into, a holy war over programming languages. (Just to get the flame bait out of the way, Visual Basic is the best language ever!) But I’ve had a number of people ask me about my experience with Rust and whether they should pick up Rust for their projects. So, I’d like to share some of the pros and cons that I see of using Rust in a startup setting, where moving fast and scaling teams is really important.
The learning curve and hiring difficulties seem to be the major culprits, in Matt’s experience.

                    <span>Why another file manager? I wanted something simple and minimalistic. Something to help me with faster navigation in the filesystem; a cd and ls replacement. So I build “llama”. It allows for quick navigation with fuzzy searching. cd integration is quite simple. And you can open vim right from the llama. That’s it. As simple and dumb as a llama.

                    <span>For our  last 2022 Kaizen episode, we went all out:
💪 @jerod outdid himself in the number of improvements shipped between Kaizens
🕺 A few of our listeners contributed → prompted us to create a new contributing guide
🗺 We now have a new infrastructure diagram
All of this, and a whole lot more, is captured as GitHub discussion 🐙 changelog.com#433. If you want to see everything that we improved, that is a great companion to this episode.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://westling.dev/b/extremely-linear-git">

                    <span>An interesting idea from Gustav Westling…
One of the things that I like to do in my projects, is to make the git history as linear as possible.
Usually this means to rebase commits onto the main branch, but it can also mean to only allow merges in one direction, from feature branches into main, never the other way around. It kind of depends on the project.
Today I’m taking this one step further, and I’m introducing a new concept: extremely linear git history.
With our extremely linear history, the first commit in a repo hash a hash that starts with 0000000, the second commit is 0000001, the third is 0000002, and so on!
How he accomplishes this is perhaps even more interesting (and hacky!)

                    <span>Matthew Tejo:
Twitter supposedly lost around 80% of its work force. What ever the real number is, there are whole teams with out engineers on it now. Yet, the website goes on and the tweets keep coming. This left a lot wondering what exactly was going on with all those engineers and made it seem like it was all just bloat. I’d like to explain my little corner of Twitter (though it wasn’t so little) and some of the work that went on that kept this thing running.
This is a detailed post about Twitter’s caching system that Matthew and others built while working there, and it’s brilliantly summed up by commenter Johnny Manu40:
When everything works fine, they wonder why they hired you. When everything stops working, they wonder why they hired you. I.T. in a nutshell.

                    <span>Christoffer Ekeroth:
I’ve become convinced that “little languages”—small languages designed to solve very specific problems—are the future of programming, particularly after reading Gabriella Gonzalez’s The end of history for programming and watching Alan Kay’s Programming and Scaling talk.
Examples of “little languages” include SQL and regular expressions. In the old days we called these DSLs, but the author argues that term has become overloaded and I have a hard time disagreeing with that.

                    <span>Homebrew creator Max Howell is back with a brand new invention:
tea is a standalone, binary download for all platforms that puts the entire open source ecosystem at your fingertips. Casually and effortlessly use the latest and greatest or the oldest and most mature from any layer of any stack. Break down the silos between programming communities, throw together scripts that use entirely separate tools and languages and share them with the world with a simple one-liner.
All you need is tea.
Bold! I love how many interesting ideas are packed in to this project: pipelines, universal virtual-env, executable markdown… the list goes on. Check out the README for all the deets. My big question is: might Max and the team be thinking too big this time around?
