Countless volumes have been written about the various benefits of serverless, a task made even easier by it being such a squishy, nebulous term that‚Äôs come to mean basically whatever the author wants it to mean. This has been a boon for AWS‚Äôs product teams, who‚Äôve gone from creating services that are clearly serverless such as DynamoDB, Route 53, IAM, and others to instead slapping the ‚Äúserverless‚Äù moniker on things that are clearly not very serverless at all, like OpenSearch and Aurora.

                    <span>Andy Jiang and Deno‚Äôs content team are really speaking my language lately:
Sites take time to build these days. A large Next.js 11 site will take several minutes to build. This is wasted time in the development cycle. Build tools like Vite or Turbopack highlight their ability to get this number down.
But the deeper question hasn‚Äôt been considered:
Why do we even need a build step?

It uses the dynamic reverse-proxy Traefik to hold requests while the new application container is started and the old one is stopped. It works seamlessly across multiple hosts, using SSHKit to execute commands. It was built for Rails applications, but works with any type of web app that can be containerized with Docker.

                    <span>Fabien Sanglard‚Äôs advice to writers:
By starting with a markup based generator, you rob yourselves of the opportunity to learn the core technology running the whole internet. Instead you will learn to use a layer built on top of it with little to no re-usable knowledge. Inevitably, you will want to do something the framework did not forecast and will come up with convoluted ways to do it anyway.
Additionally, depending on how long you will write and how often you do it, setting up a generator may be counterproductive.
The best way to avoid the YAGNI trap is to start as simple as possible and only add tech when you‚Äôre absolutely sure the ROI is higher than the TCO.

We‚Äôre excited to announce changes that make getting Google Trust Services TLS certificates easier for Google Domains customers. With this integration, all Google Domains customers will be able to acquire public certificates for their websites at no additional cost, whether the site runs on a Google service or uses another provider. Additionally, Google Domains is now making an API available¬†to allow for DNS-01 challenges with Google Domains DNS servers to issue and renew certificates automatically.





Like the existing Google Cloud¬†integration, Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol is used to enable seamless automatic lifecycle management of TLS certificates.¬†

Ever since we talked with Cory Wilkerson about Coding in the cloud with Codespaces we‚Äôve wanted to get the Changelog.com codebase setup with a dev environment in the cloud to more easily support contributions. After getting a drive-by contribution from Chris Eggert to add a Dev Container spec to our codebase, we got curious and reached out to Brigit and asked her to come on the show to give us all the details.

                    <span>Evan Hahn, describing what he calls the ‚Äúlone developer problem‚Äù:
A lot of software is built by one person. It might be an entire product built by a lone developer or a significant piece of a system.
When this happens, I‚Äôve observed that code written by a single developer is usually hard for others to work with. This code must‚Äôve made sense to the author, who I think is very smart, but it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me!
All this time, I just thought it was my code that was hard for others to work with! Turns out I‚Äôm not alone‚Ä¶

                    <span>The UI of the open source OKLCH Color Picker &amp; Converter was created with community education in mind as the driving design principle. Beyond being a handy tool, there was a secondary goal: speeding up familiarity and adoption of OKLCH and perceptual color spaces.
To that end, this article explains how the underlying reality of the color space itself guided the UI design.

1. Bring Chrome under Cloud Management
 Your journey towards keeping your Google Workspace users and data safe, starts with bringing your Chrome browsers under Cloud Management at no additional cost. Chrome Browser Cloud Management is a single destination for applying Chrome Browser policies and security controls across Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. You also get deep visibility into your browser fleet including which browsers are out of date, which extensions your users are using and bringing insight to potential security blindspots in your enterprise. 
Managing Chrome from the cloud allows Google Workspace admins to enforce enterprise protections and policies to the whole browser on fully managed devices, which  no longer ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The common trope that feedback is a gift is a misnomer: we love giving and receiving gifts but recoil from delivering and accepting feedback. Some truths are hard to hear and discuss, so the gift-giving metaphor falls short.
What if I told you there was a way to overcome that sinking feeling associated with delivering feedback? Yes, delivering great actionable feedback is a learnable skill that improves with deliberate practice. Read my post to learn some useful techniques.

                    <span>With the recent proliferation of generative AI models (from OpenAI, co:here, Anthropic, etc.), practitioners are racing to come up with best practices around prompting, grounding, and control of outputs.
Chris and Daniel take a deep dive into the kinds of behavior we are seeing with this latest wave of models (both good and bad) and what leads to that behavior. They also dig into some prompting and integration tips.

                    <span>I was a programmer for 12 years. I then switched to support and people management for 12 years. I now want to go back to programming for the rest of my career. I started working at Zed Industries on January the 17th, helping build the Zed editor and be a Rust programmer wannabe. End of June is going to be the judgment day. Will I remain part of Zed?
That‚Äôs right. I have a six month contract with the company my ex-GitHub colleague founded. They are trusting me to become productive in Rust within 6 months. With no prior experience in Rust, this feels like a Herculean feat. The interesting part is that I abandoned a high-paying job to do this. And by the end of the six month contract, Zed Industries and I may decide to part ways and still be friends.
And I am blogging about my experience so far. It‚Äôs a mix of personal learnings and small technical bits and pieces sprinkled here and there. But it‚Äôs mostly about my personal experience.

My goal here is to show how something that looks complicated can be broken down into simple pieces, and if I‚Äôve done my job right, it should feel like you‚Äôve discovered how the game works.

Connected TV (CTV) has not only transformed the entertainment world, it has also created a vibrant new platform for digital advertising. However, as with any innovative space, there are challenges that arise, including the emergence of bad actors aiming to siphon money away from advertisers and publishers through fraudulent or invalid ad traffic. Invalid traffic is an evolving challenge that has the potential to affect the integrity and health of digital advertising on CTV. However, there are steps the industry can take to combat invalid traffic and foster a clean, trustworthy, and sustainable ecosystem.

                    <span>Ben Hoyt shares his experience switching two of his side projects from on an EC2 instance to Fly.io:
It took me about an hour to figure out the basics of Fly.io and move the simpler project, and a couple of evenings to move the more complex one. Fly.io handles the annoying reverse proxy and SSL stuff, deployment is as simple as fly deploy, and there‚Äôs a nice dashboard on Fly.io to show me what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm only a few weeks into using Fly.io to host my side projects, but I‚Äôm very happy with their product so far. I was quite happy to delete the 500 lines of Ansible scripts, systemd unit files, and Caddy config files.
It also made me smile to finally stop the EC2 instance and bump my AWS bill down from $9 per month to about 10 cents per month (I still use S3 for user-uploaded images and for backups). I have nothing against EC2 and would use it again for certain things, but for small web applications, Fly.io seems like a great fit.

                    <span>Akshay Khot:
Although Hotwire (an approach to building web apps without much JS by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire.) is closely tied to Ruby on Rails, you might be surprised to know that you don‚Äôt really need Rails to learn, play, and experiment with Hotwire. In this article, I will show you how a simple static website can use Turbo Drive and Frames to make it more dynamic and responsive.
We‚Äôve been using the predecessor to Hotwire‚Äôs Turbo Drive on this very website (an Elixir app) for 7 (!) years now, so I‚Äôm convinced there are valid uses of Hotwire outside of its usual Rails context.

                    <span>This week Evan Prodromou is back to take us deeper into the Fediverse. As many of us reconsider our relationship with Twitter, Mastodon has been by-and-large the target of migration. They helped to popularize the idea of a federated universe of community-owned, decentralized, social networks. And, at the heart of it all is ActivityPub. ActivityPub is a decentralized social networking protocol published by the W3C. It is co-authored by Evan as well as; Christine Lemmer-Webber, Jessica Tallon, Erin Shepherd, and Amy Guy. Today, Evan shares the details behind this protocol and where the Fediverse might be heading.

                    <span>The rough math goes like this: We spent $3.2m on cloud in 2022. Just under a million of that was on storing 8 petabytes of files in S3, fully replicated across several regions. So that leaves ~$2.3m on everything else: app servers, cache servers, database servers, search servers, the works. That‚Äôs the part of the budget we intend to bring to zero in 2023. Then we‚Äôll worry about exiting the 8PB from S3 in 2024.
David spoke at length on this decision when he was on Ship It! late last year.

Despite their best efforts, all weather apps will eventually lie.
Weather is often hyper-local‚Ä¶
So, in 2013, I set up a Davis Vantage Vue integrated sensor suite (ISS) and mounted it on a pole attached to my garage.
The heart of his system is WeeWX, a free and open source weather station software written in Python. Ten years later, he‚Äôs learned some things, but he‚Äôs still using his homegrown weather monitoring.

                    <span>Yury Molodtsov:
Running your own blog in 2023 is still needlessly complicated, especially if you have any kind of taste. Why have one in the first place?
Social apps and networks are obviously the easiest options, but they‚Äôre geared toward vastly different things, and I just don‚Äôt trust their longevity. Having your own platform enables flexibility and portability, so your content can be kept online practically forever.
This!
There are many options out there, ranging from WordPress and Ghost to static blogs to managed online platforms and Micro.blog. How do you choose between them?
What follows is a survey of some of the popular tools and what Yury thinks about them. My advice is this: don‚Äôt worry too much about tooling. That‚Äôs the easy part. Writing‚Äôs the hard part. We often bike shed the easy parts to avoid the hard part. Yuri seems to agree:
Having the right tool certainly helps, but at the end of the day, what matters is what you write there. Focus more on the content and just ensure the process of writing and posting is simple enough.

                    <span>My opinionated list of four approaches to building websites and web applications. Publicly hosted on the internet, serving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc over HTTP.
There are more than four ways to build a web app, but the ones Tom covers in-depth in this post are:
Hugo Static Sites + Progressive Web Apps
Cloudflare Workers
Linux Server Singleton

A modern Android powered smartphone is a complex hardware device: Android OS runs on a multi-core CPU - also called an Application Processor (AP). And the AP is one of many such processors of a System On Chip (SoC). Other processors on the SoC perform various specialized tasks ‚Äî such as security functions, image &amp; video processing, and most importantly cellular communications. The processor performing cellular communications is often referred to as the baseband. For the purposes of this blog, we refer to the software that runs on all these other processors as ‚ÄúFirmware‚Äù.  
Securing the Android Platform requires going beyond the confines of the Application Processor (AP). Android‚Äôs defense-in-depth ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Antoine Vastel:
The new headless Chrome has been released in November 2022. For the moment, it hasn‚Äôt become the standard headless mode. It‚Äôs still hidden behind a ‚Äìheadless&#x3D;new flag. However, it will soon become the standard headless mode, and this is going to change a lot of things when it comes to bot detection, particularly detection based on browser fingerprint.
Antoine is the head of research at DataDome, a bot detection company, so he knows what he‚Äôs talking about here. The good news is you can still detect the new headless Chrome, but it will be more tricky. The other good news is that fingerprinting is just one of many tools in the bot detector‚Äôs belt. Others include request behavior, reputation scores, proxy detection &amp; TLS fingerprinting.

                    <span>Sloth is a native Mac app that shows all open files, directories, sockets, pipes, and devices in use by all running processes on your system. This makes it easy to inspect which apps are using which files, etc.
lsof is powerful, but I use it infrequently and its CLI is inscrutable. That‚Äôs a perfect setup for a GUI like this.

                    <span>Nikola ƒêuza lays out a way you can customize your README to stand out from the crowd:
GitHub supports adding HTML in Markdown, but it is pretty aggressive when removing HTML that can be potentially dangerous to users. Things like scripts, iframes, and similar will get removed or ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù to avoid malicious content from being served to users.
Luckily, there‚Äôs one way to sneak in some HTML (or a web page) inside the README. You can do it via SVG and foreignObject SVG element.

SQLite is one of those projects that I wish I had known about long before I did. I had heard about it, but for many years I never thought about taking a serious look at it because I was under the false impression that is was a tiny database only useful for personal address books and small embedded devices.
I highly recommend you take a look at SQLite!

                    <span>Tim McNamara is known as New Zealand‚Äôs Rust guy. He is the author of Rust in Action, and also a Senior Software Engineer at AWS, where he helps other builders with all things Rust.
The main reason why Gerhard is intrigued by Rust is the incredible resource frugality. Fewer CPUs means less energy used, which is good for the planet, and good for the monthly bill. This becomes most noticeable at Amazon‚Äôs scale, when S3, Lambda, CloudFront and other services start adding Rust components.

                    <span>Rust and Haskell don‚Äôt shy away from powerful features. As a result, both languages have steep learning curves when compared with other languages. Trying to learn Rust or Haskell can be frustrating, especially in the first couple of months.
But if you already know Rust, you have a head start with Haskell; and vice versa.
In this article, we want to show how knowledge of one of these languages can help you get up to speed with another.

                    <span>In a post about overestimating our short-term ability and underestimate our long-term ability, Paavan drops this nugget:
It‚Äôs important to recognise the value of quantity over quality. This is best illustrated by an anecdote that I first heard from Kevin Cannon at PUSH Conference: a potter who spends time making 100 vases will end up with one that‚Äôs better quality than if they spent the same amount of time trying to just make 1 perfect vase. So, while quality is obviously important, focussing on quantity at the start of a creative journey is the way to get there.
I‚Äôve never heard that anecdote before, but I absolutely love the truth it so clearly represents.

In this blog post, I‚Äôll elucidate why backlogs exist and why they never shrink. Then, I‚Äôll expound on why they‚Äôre useless and harmful. Finally, I‚Äôll demonstrate how one can work without a backlog and explain why it‚Äôs much more productive to do so.
I agree whole heartedly with his ‚Äúwhy they never shrink‚Äù logic, but I‚Äôm not willing to say that makes them ‚Äúuseless and harmful.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure Lucas even believes that, since his advice of what to do instead at the end of the post boils down to ‚Äúkeep a short backlog.‚Äù
Still, I enjoy Lucas‚Äôs thought process and you might too. Recommended reading.

                    <span>This short piece by Jim Nielsen resonated with me (much like Manu‚Äôs post resonated with Jim). He says:
I like this idea of beginning to notice and bring attention to people or creative works that intentionally bring closure, even when you‚Äôre left wanting a little more.
When it comes to open source software, people often see a lack of activity and proclaim that a project is unmaintained. Sometimes that‚Äôs true, but sometimes the project is merely finished, and that‚Äôs okay. In fact, it‚Äôs better than okay. It‚Äôs downright successful.
There‚Äôs a big difference between quitting and finishing. Quitting is in the realm of failure, but finishing is in the realm of success. The key is to define what finished means before you get there, lest you feel like you‚Äôre merely quitting.
The art of knowing when to quit? Sure. But how about the art of knowing how to finish?

                    <span>For many hackers, programmers, and computer scientists, having an understanding of graph theory is immensely helpful. But what about those who do not have this background?
This blog posts adapts Scott Young‚Äôs Ultralearning approach and applies it to learning graph theory for those who many not have a formal training in maths!

                    <span>Creator Tyler Deitz says:
StreetPass is a browser extension that helps you find your people on Mastodon. It piggybacks off the way Mastodon handles decentralized identity verification and turns it into a simple discovery tool that recommends users based on the websites you visit! Available for Chrome and Firefox (soon Safari).
Discovery is one of the more challenging facets of federated social networking. It gets even more challenging now that Twitter‚Äôs API is getting paywall‚Äôd, so most of the free tools to port your Twitter social graph over to Mastodon will quit working. I expect more tools like StreetPass to pop up in the coming days as the Fediverse seems to be capturing that hacker spirit Twitter once embraced.
