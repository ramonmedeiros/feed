                    <span>Johannes Schuck holds the opinion that state machines are underrated. So he wrote this:
The goal of this list of facts is not to teach you what state machines are or how to use them; there are plenty of other resources for that. Rather, the goal here is to motivate their usage and to highlight things about them that are frequently overlooked, but nonetheless relevant.

Lars Wikman joins the show to give us a guided tour through ID3 esoterica and the shiny new open source Elixir library he developed for us. We talk about what ID3 is, its many versions, what it aims to be and what it could have been, how our library project got started, all the unique features and failed dreams of the ID3v2 spec, how ID3v2 and Podcast 2.0 are solving the problem differently, and how all of this maps back to us giving you (our listeners) a better experience while listening to our shows.

There‚Äôs clearly a lot of programmer pain. But why we don‚Äôt see more tech transfer of these ‚Äúdeep‚Äù technologies from research into industry is something I have been thinking about since I was in college, when I decided I wanted to spend my life making programmers‚Äô lives better. Many other fields, from robotics to databases, have clearer paths to commercialization. But when it comes to new programming languages or software analyses, the path of tech transfer is often decades-long, if it exists at all.
She goes on to describe a few factors that are in the way of ‚Äúdeep tech‚Äù dev tools investing, how some of those things are changing, and how others still need to change.

Built for Dark Mode:  Most templates are built using light colors and later on adapted to dark colors. Dark themes shouldn‚Äôt be an afterthought, they should be a top priority.
Designer Friendly: Speed up the prototyping phase by using a highly configurable Design System. Collaborate easily by taking advantage of a carefully crafted Figma file.
Great Developer Experience: Don‚Äôt worry about class names, just use the Visual Studio Code snippets. You can take advantage of autocomplete and also access the entire documentation right from your code editor.

Chapters are neat, they let you see a Table of Contents, jump to specific parts and similar. The changelog.com site is an open source project built in Elixir. I love working with Elixir. It is a steadily growing but still somewhat niche language and it doesn‚Äôt have every library under the sun, only most of them. It hasn‚Äôt had a fully fledged ID3v2 library so far. There are a few libraries that let you parse a tag in one specific way, targeting a subset. I haven‚Äôt found any that allow writing a tag.

We then talked about Rawkode Academy, and we finished with conferences. Good thing we did, because David almost forgot about KubeHuddle, the conference that he is co-organising next week. Gerhard is looking forward to talking at it! No, seriously, check it out at kubehuddle.com.

                    <span>MNT Research‚Ä¶ is going small for its next project. The MNT Pocket Reform has a seven-inch screen with a clamshell design that, when closed, will be less than five centimeters thick. If its perky purple facade looks a bit retro, that‚Äôs no surprise; the Pocket‚Äôs inspirations read like a ‚Äògreatest hits‚Äô list of pocketable computers.
They‚Äôre taking open source seriously:
MNT‚Äôs open-source promise is not limited to an open source operating system or select internal components The Pocket Reform, as with MNT‚Äôs full-size Reform laptop, will provide mainboard schematics, 3D models for physical components, and open source drivers, among other things.
Coming soon to a crowd fund near you.

Our mission is to enable anyone to build multi-page dynamic web apps while staying as close to the platform as possible. Enhance fills in the gaps to make building for the backend, and the browser a seamless experience for web authors and consumers.
Modern JavaScript frameworks bring more problems than they solve; recreating native web platform features adding unnecessary weight and complexity, which is challenging to unravel.
Enhance provides a dependable foundation built on standards-based web platform features, allowing developers to create web applications that are lightweight, flexible, and future-proof.

                    <span>Vivian Qu states her case as to why Apple‚Äôs decision to remove outdated apps from the App Store is dumb, especially for indies like her.
Never mind the fact that my app has a 5-star rating and was still being downloaded, with no complaints from any of my users. Also disregard the fact that I had other highly-rated apps up on the App Store, some of which had been updated much more recently than July 2019, clearly showing that I have not abandoned these apps entirely. If there had been an actual reviewer who checked my outdated app, they would have discovered that I architected the app from the beginning to dynamically scale the UI so it resizes to fit the latest iPhone devices. All these could be signals that indicate to Apple that this is not a garbage-filled scam app that is lowering the quality of their App Store.
She goes on to tell the entire saga that she (and others) were put through to keep their apps on the store. Sometimes an app isn‚Äôt outdated, it‚Äôs just complete. Ya know?

                    <span>This project is a web implementation of the raining green code seen in the Matrix franchise. It‚Äôs built right on top of the upcoming graphics API WebGPU, but falls back to the functional WebGL wrapper, REGL; its previous Three.js version is maintained in a separate branch.
I used to spend countless hours in college scouring the web for the best digital rain screen saver for my laptop. Sounds like the author is with me on that:
The number of implementations out there of this effect is a testament to the size of the film‚Äôs impact on popular culture. For decades, I‚Äôve enjoyed searching for and comparing them from time to time. That‚Äôs probably how you arrived here‚Äî it‚Äôs fun to see what kinds of solutions different people come up with to a problem, when the process is purely recreational and its success is subjective.
This one‚Äôs really nice and even has a 3D mode. The README says it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade with love‚Äù, but from what I can tell it‚Äôs almost entirely JavaScript. üòú

                    <span>This week we‚Äôre talking about product development structures as systems with Lucas da Costa. The last time we had Lucas on the show he was living the text-mode only life, and now we‚Äôre more than 3 years later, Lucas has doubled down on all things text mode. Today‚Äôs conversation with Lucas maps several ideas he‚Äôs shared recently on his blog. We talk about deadlines being pointless, trajectory vs roadmap and the downfall of long-term planning, the practices of daily stand-ups and what to do instead, measuring queues not cycle time, and probably the most controversial of them all ‚Äî actually talking to your customers. Have you heard? It‚Äôs this newly disruptive Agile framework that seems to be working well.

That‚Äôs pretty useful! I used to struggle to shove conditionals in to my cron jobs. Example time:
from rocketry.conds import daily, time_of_week
from pathlib import Path

@app.cond()
def file_exists(file):

They‚Äôre such a great way to navigate and explore an episode. You can skip directly to the subjects that interest you, skip past the ones that don‚Äôt, and even discover new parts of the show1 that pique your interest.
I‚Äôm a big chapters user myself; have been ever since the feature was added to my podcast app of choice and some podcasts I listen to added them. But we never put in the work to chapter our podcasts because of various challenges in our way.
The challenges
We‚Äôve self-hosted (and self-content-managed) our podcasts since 2016. To get that done, we built our own web app because, well, we‚Äôre software developers2 and as the saying goes:

Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.
We might need to give this a spin on our transcripts. Who knows, maybe our next big innovation could be The Changelog in German, French, Spanish, etc!

                    <span>Dave Rupert brainstorms some new CSS organization acronyms.
I‚Äôm not anti-BEM nor anti-roboclasses, but as we enter a new era for CSS I think we have an opportunity to rethink best practices around architecting CSS. Before we get lost rethinking the wheel, let‚Äôs hold on to some good principles from the past decade or so:
We want to author in components
We generally want low-specificity to avoid collisions
We want a bucket of global utility classes/variables for ad-hoc composition or customizations
With those principles, let‚Äôs dive into some CSS architecture alternatives.

                    <span>iliana etaoin:
There is a lot of attention on securing ‚Äúsoftware supply chains.‚Äù The usual approach is that you want to try to avoid security issues in your underlying components from impacting customers of your product; and when they do, you want to be able to respond quickly to fix the issue. The people who care about this class of problem are often software companies. The class of components that are most concerning these companies are ones where unpaid hobbyist maintainers wrote something for themselves with no maintenance plan.
This is where the supply chain metaphor ‚Äî and it is just that, a metaphor ‚Äî breaks down‚Ä¶
I think we all know this intrinsically, but it‚Äôs easy to forget. iliana goes on to describe feelings I‚Äôve heard expressed by a few maintainers recently:
I just want to publish software that I think is neat so that other hobbyists can use and learn from it, and I otherwise want to be left the hell alone. I should be allowed to decide if something I wrote is ‚Äúdone‚Äù. The focus on securing the ‚Äúsoftware supply chain‚Äù has made it even more likely that releasing software for others to use will just mean more work for me that I don‚Äôt benefit from. I reject the idea that a concept so tenuous can be secured in the first place.

                    <span>Here‚Äôs Paul Graham with some wise advice he‚Äôs learned from YC‚Äôs users ‚Äî this also tees up a large conversation on this Friday‚Äôs episode of The Changelog (talk to your users).
I recently told applicants to Y Combinator that the best advice I could give for getting in, per word, was. Explain what you‚Äôve learned from users.
Here‚Äôs why that makes sense.
That tests a lot of things: whether you‚Äôre paying attention to users, how well you understand them, and even how much they need what you‚Äôre making.
But giving this advice made Paul consider what he has learned from YC‚Äôs users (the startups they‚Äôve funded). This one is almost clich√© at this point, but still quite true.
Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don‚Äôt have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don‚Äôt matter, there‚Äôs no one focusing on the things that do.

                    <span>GitHub this month installed a massive steel vault, etched with striking AI-generated art, deep within an Arctic mountain, finalizing its Arctic Code Vault. This vault contains the 188 reels of hardened archival film which will preserve the 02/02/202 snapshot of every active public GitHub repository for 1,000 years. It also now includes a Tech Tree, a human-readable selection of works describing software, computers, and their foundational technologies, along with full-text copies of Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, and other data sources.</span>

Watch the &lt;1 hour video to write a simplified Svelte compiler &lt;300 lines of code is amazing! Easy to follow, inspiring, and gives a great overview of how to write a compiler.

                    <span>Here‚Äôs the motivation behind this Rust-based TUI:
I do most of my git work in a terminal but I frequently found myself using git GUIs for some use-cases like: index, commit, diff, stash, blame and log.
Unfortunately popular git GUIs all fail on giant repositories or become unresponsive and unusable.
GitUI provides you with the user experience and comfort of a git GUI but right in your terminal while being portable, fast, free and open source.

This gets an A+ for creativity. Fire up your shell, then launch Neovim. Then shell out with :VimShell to get back to where you started, but with Copilot suggestions.
My guess is the ergonomics of this are‚Ä¶ bad. But a cool hack, regardless!

                    <span>Devon Zuegel draws a comparison that I would‚Äôve never thought of:
Pirate crews developed a surprisingly similar approach to compensation in the 17th century. Just like many startups, they also balanced equity incentives with other mechanisms that would be familiar to a startup employee today, such as bonuses.
These surprising similarities offer an interesting frame through which we can reflect on why startup equity and bonuses are structured the way they are. We can learn a lot about the theory of compensation in modern companies by looking at how pirates designed incentives to organize and motivate their work.
Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop hiring ‚Äúfrontend wizards‚Äù and start looking for ‚Äúfrontend pirates‚Äù instead, matey.

                    <span>I joined Google earlier this year to lead a new function: Technology &amp; Society. Our aim is to help connect research, people and ideas across Google to shape the future of our technology innovations and their impact on society for the better. A key area of focus is AI, a field I have studied and immersed myself in over the years. I recently met with a team at the Google AI Center in Ghana that is using advanced technology to address an ancient problem: detecting locust outbreaks which threaten food security and livelihoods for millions of people. And in India and Bangladesh, our Crisis Response teams are using our machine-learning-based forecasting to provide over 360 million people with alerts about upcoming floods.


Efforts like these make me optimistic about how AI can contribute to sol‚Ä¶</span>

Of course you can use this model to quickly and easily create amazing, dream-like images to post on twitter, reddit, discord, etc., but this technology is also poised to be used in very pragmatic ways across industry.

                    <span>A lot of ink has been spilt over the years trying to elucidate the divide between junior and senior. Mi≈Çosz Piechocki makes the distinction this way:
Junior Engineers care about writing Software. They value code quality, employ best practices, try to adopt cutting-edge technologies. They invest a lot of time into learning new technologies. To them, the ultimate goal is to create elegant, performant, maintainable software.
Senior Engineers care about building Systems. To them, creating software is just one of the steps. First of all, they question whether the software needs to be built in the first place. They ask what problems would it solve and why it‚Äôs important to solve them. They inquire who will be using the software and on what scale. They think about where the software would run and how they‚Äôre going to monitor whether it‚Äôs working properly. They also decide how to measure whether the software is actually solving the problems it was supposed to solve.
He goes on to describe how hard it is to build Systems and lists activities that are part of that process.

Today we‚Äôre going to talk about a different approach to solving the same type of bugs.

                    <span>Josh Collinsworth (an unapologetic React non-fan) writes on his blog about the ubiquity of React:
I don‚Äôt know what the future of front-end looks like. Nobody really does. But it‚Äôs a very safe bet that React will continue to be the thing for a very long time.
If you‚Äôre learning front-end development in the hopes of getting a job, or trying to level up your career, and React is a knowledge gap for you, it seems like the safest bet you could make. React isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon. That said, however‚Ä¶
But why does React remain on top?
Because we don‚Äôt always value the strongest choice as much as we value consensus. (In fact, you could make an argument that consensus is the strongest choice, in many ways.)
React keeps getting picked‚Ä¶because React keeps getting picked.
But there‚Äôs a ton more to unpack. Josh got into the details on the best choice for the job, covering: Performance, learning curve, bundle size, scalability, community and support, financial backing, hireability, and developer experience.
Should I spoil it for you? Nah. Read Josh‚Äôs words for the full story.

This project really is a culmination of 4 years of work trying to make the best library for web scraping in production. Web scraping is a very dynamic environment and what works today might not work tomorrow, so we at Apify had to go through a lot of trial and error to figure out the most reliable and convenient ways of crawling the web and scraping data. We hope that we finally cracked it and that now many developers will enjoy working with our new library and it will make their scrapers more reliable and time to production faster.
I like how it starts with simple HTTP-based scraping, but can switch to browser-based automation when a site has JavaScript rendering. I don‚Äôt love the built-in proxy rotation features. Not because they‚Äôre bad, per se, but because they make spammers lives easier‚Ä¶

Recently, OSS-Fuzz‚Äîour community fuzzing service that regularly checks 700 critical open source projects for bugs‚Äîdetected a serious vulnerability (CVE-2022-3008): a bug in the TinyGLTF project that could have allowed attackers to execute malicious code in projects using TinyGLTF as a dependency.   
The bug was soon patched, but the wider significance remains: OSS-Fuzz caught a trivially exploitable command injection vulnerability. This discovery shows that fuzzing, a type of testing once primarily known for detecting memory corruption vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, has considerable untapped potential to find broader classes of vulnerabilities. Though the TinyGLTF library is written in C++, this vuln‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In June 2021, we decided to start converting the source code for MDN web docs from HTML into a format that would be easier for us to work with. The goal was to get 100% of our manually-written documentation converted to Markdown, and we really had a mountain of source code to climb for this particular expedition.
In this post, we‚Äôll describe why we decided to migrate to Markdown, and the steps you can take that will help us on our mission.
The post The 100% Markdown Expedition appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

                    <span>The Preact team dropped a new state management solution on us:
Signals are a way of expressing state that ensure apps stay fast regardless of how complex they get. Signals are based on reactive principles and provide excellent developer ergonomics, with a unique implementation optimized for Virtual DOM.
Adding Signals to your Preact app only adds 1.6kB to your bundle size. So what‚Äôs the big idea?
The main idea behind signals is that instead of passing a value directly through the component tree, we pass a signal object containing the value (similar to a ref). When a signal‚Äôs value changes, the signal itself stays the same. As a result, signals can be updated without re-rendering the components they‚Äôve been passed through, since components see the signal and not its value. This lets us skip all of the expensive work of rendering components and jump immediately to the specific components in the tree that actually access the signal‚Äôs value.

Go provides tooling to analyze your codebase and surface known vulnerabilities. This tooling is backed by the Go vulnerability database, which is curated by the Go security team. Go‚Äôs tooling reduces noise in your results by only surfacing vulnerabilities in functions that your code is actually calling.
There‚Äôs a new govulncheck command you can/should install and run against your project. It surfaces only the vulnerabilities that actually affect you, which is awesome.
Govulncheck is a standalone tool to allow frequent updates and rapid iteration while we gather feedback from users. In the long term, we plan to integrate the govulncheck tool into the main Go distribution.
