                    <span>This post reacting to other people’s reaction to GitLab’s recent free tier changes starts kinda rant-y:
Lots of users expect to get things for free, forever, from for-profit companies that don’t answer to them. Those users contribute almost nothing1 to the bottom line for the for-profit companies, and actively drive up costs for them. Yet, somehow, with no skin in the game, they feel entitled to complain and badmouth the companies because they’re not getting as much value for their monthly contribution of nothing at all.
But it ends with a pretty strong call to build things for ourselves:
Create a business case, get the funding, stand up the infrastructure, and pay people to work on it rather than expecting for-profit companies to prioritize (what you see as) the public good over profit. Whether that’s how things should be or not, it is how they are and that isn’t going to change as long as the only movement in the direction of change is people hectoring for-profit companies to do better.

                    <span>When Rich Harris was last on JS Party, he wondered aloud:
“Should I learn Rust? Should we rewrite the Svelte compiler in Rust?” Maybe it’s a terrible idea, I don’t know, but I think it’s at least worth investigating.
Well, the effort we’re linking to here isn’t by Rich, but another member of the Svelte community. Their reasoning:
My main reason for doing this, is to compile Svelte without Node.js and possibly use Deno instead.
And the state of the project:
This is still a big work in progress. I’m mainly working on this for fun and learning. I came up with the name rustle by combining rust and svelte (ruslte &#x3D;&gt; rustle). The project is open to naming suggestions!

                    <span>Not every hash algorithm is appropriate in all scenarios, and in fact, very few algorithms are usable in more than a couple of situations. Even worse, using the wrong algorithm will lead in the best case scenario to performance problems, but in the worst case scenario to security issues and even financial loss. Thus, knowing which algorithm to pick for which application is crucial.
Therefore I’ll try to summarize how I approach the topic of hashing, including use-cases, recommended algorithms, and links to other articles.

                    <span>Chip Huyen:
As machine learning moves towards real-time, streaming technology is becoming increasingly important for data scientists. Like many people coming from a machine learning background, I used to dread streaming. In our recent survey, almost half of the data scientists we asked said they would like to move from batch prediction to online prediction but can’t because streaming is hard, both technically and operationally…
Over the last year, working with a co-founder who’s super deep into streaming, I’ve learned that streaming can be quite intuitive. This post is an attempt to rephrase what I’ve learned.

Rather than iterating over, sorting, and ordering rows, what if the data was in data structures you wanted from the ground up? Early on, it was used much like Memcached, but as Redis improved, it became viable for many other use cases, including publish-subscribe mechanisms, streaming, and queues.

                    <span>We’re longtime users of Action Mailer and wanted something similar for our TypeScript/React apps. We didn’t find anything, so we decided to build Mailing.
We added some features that we would’ve liked in Action Mailer, like a mobile toggle (with hotkeys), and the ability to send a test email from the browser while developing. We went all in on MJML so that we (almost) never have to think about email clients or nested tables :)
Plays well with the popular JS web frameworks, too. Demo video here.

                    <span>Mike Melanson gives props to the language many of us (myself included) enjoy lampooning:
While Java may have hit some hiccups earlier in its life, nowadays the language and its greater ecosystem have picked up the pace to meet the needs of the future in a variety of ways. In fact, it never really went anywhere: Companies like Amazon, Google, Netflix, Pinterest, Spotify, Square, and Zoom all employ Java across their vast codebases. Not to mention much of the high-scale data infrastructure over the past decade has been powered by Java, with the language serving as the backbone for the likes of Apache Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark.
You’ll have to read the article to see how he backs up statements like this one:
After nearly 30 years of Java, you might expect the language to be showing some signs of wear and tear, but nothing could be further from the truth. Java in 2022 is not a language in decline, but rather a language preparing for the effervescent future of software development.

The Linux kernel is a key component for the security of the Internet. Google uses Linux in almost everything, from the computers our employees use, to the products people around the world use daily like Chromebooks, Android on phones, cars, and TVs, and workloads on Google Cloud. Because of this, we have heavily invested in Linux’s security - and today, we’re announcing how we’re building on those investments and increasing our rewards.

The purpose of MiniRust is to describe the semantics of an interesting fragment of Rust in a way that is both precise and understandable to as many people as possible… Specifically, MiniRust is specified by a reference interpreter that describes the step-by-step process of executing a MiniRust program, including checking at each step whether the program has Undefined Behavior.

                    <span>Daily stand-ups are a classic example of learned helplessness. We all know they’re useless, but we tell ourselves “that’s just how things are” and do nothing about it.
Lucas provides a set of five symptoms that indicate you’re doing stand-ups wrong and says if your team hits at least three of the five, your stand-ups are useless.
But, instead of just telling you to stop doing them (like I probably would), he provides a bunch of solid advice on how to make them useful again.

                    <span>The story of Kells is an inspiring one, to say the least!
I started this game back in 2020 as a fun little side-project to pass the time during the pandemic with lots of help from my son. Back then we didn’t even expect it to be playable, never mind it turning into a real game with 100+ levels and being released on Steam/PC. But even after that milestone, I never dreamed my son and I would be able to play it together around the TV on our favourite console!

                    <span>Clojure is often lauded, but you don’t see too many teams actually using it to build production systems. “Why Clojure?” is what the Penpot team gets asked the most, so they lay their reasoning out in this article. The TLDR:
Though it is not a mainstream language, Clojure was the right language for Penpot to choose because of its key features: stability, backwards compatibility, and syntactic abstraction.

 There are various threats a user faces when browsing the web. Users may be tricked into sharing sensitive information like their passwords with a misleading or fake website, also called phishing. They may also be led into installing malicious software on their machines, called malware, which can collect personal data and also hold it for ransom. Google Chrome, henceforth called Chrome, enables its users to protect themselves from such threats on the internet. When Chrome users browse the web with Safe Browsing protections, Chrome uses the Safe Browsing service from Google to identify and ward off various threats. 
Safe Browsing works in different ways depending on the user&#x27;s preferences. In the most common case, Chrome uses the privacy…</span>

As a companion to this episode, Jerod and Adam shipped a special Backstage episode where they reflect on 500 episodes. And…not only has it been a journey for us, but it’s also been a journey for our good friend Chris Coyier and CSS-Tricks — which he grew from his personal blog to a massively popular contributor driven model, complete with an editor-in-chief, a wide array of influential contributors, and advertisers to help fund the way. The news, of course, is that CSS-Tricks was recently acquired by DigitalOcean in March of 2022. We get into all the details of this deal, his journey, and the legacy of CSS-Tricks.

                    <span>Michael Guarino lays out how the engineering team at Plural brought K8s to the browser for their users:
Overall, we had a ton of fun building this feature. It allowed us to delve into an often unexplored area of the Kubernetes API, which I am honestly happy that we got to explore. This project also took an unexpected turn in its use of tmux and exposed us to a genuinely mind-blowing project in xtermjs (I’m shocked the community had the patience to write a full shell in javascript!).

                    <span>Our today’s guest spent 4 days building a feature for his side project so that we could ship it together on Ship It!, while recording. The feature is called rave mode, and the context is Bass, an interpreted functional scripting language written in Go, riffing on the ideas of Kernel &amp; Clojure. When the local build runs, you can now press r to synchronise the beats of your currently playing Spotify track with the build output. For a demo, see bass v0.9.0 release.
Please welcome Alex Suraci, a.k.a. vito, the creator of Concourse CI and Bass.
This episode is dedicated to the late John Shutt, the creator of Kernel.
Your ideas continue in Bass.
Thank you for getting them out into the world.

I’m a CLI junkie, addicted to Vim motions, and never miss an opportunity to bring those two in to any part of my workflow. Naturally, I love to geek out about command line utilities and am always on the lookout for the next tool that can improve my productivity or just make CLI more fun to use. I can confidently say that Fzf is one of the handful of tools I’ve discovered over the years that has done both and has,thus, significantly improved the quality of my command line life.

                    <span>I have to admit, I enjoy making fun of PHP. Mostly because the language itself is a fractal of bad design. But I (try to) do it with love, because language design is just one part of what makes a programming environment good. This post is a nice reminder of the many reasons why PHP and JavaScript are awesome.
Over the last twenty years, I have used over a dozen languages professionally, from C to Common Lisp, from Java to Python, from C++ to Typescript.
Yet, I love janky programming languages. In particular, I really enjoy PHP and JavaScript.
Here’s why.
I particularly agree with the point at the end about legacy codebases, many of which are powered by PHP and JS:
A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.
For me, nothing comes close to the pleasure of improving a product with many users.

                    <span>A lot of ink is spent on the “monoliths vs. microservices” debate, but the real issue behind this debate is about whether distributed system architecture is worth the developer time and cost overheads. By thinking about the real operational considerations of our systems, we can get some insight into whether we actually need distributed systems for most things.
Scaling up has always been easier than scaling out. It’s amazing what one beefy server can do these days…

I used to think being swamped was a good sign. I’m doing stuff! I’m making progress! I’m important! I have an excuse to make others wait! Then I realized being swamped just means I’m stuck in the default state, like a ball that settled to a stop in the deepest part of an empty pool, the spot where rainwater has collected into a puddle.
Good analogy. Better sentiment. Reminds me of Woody Zuill’s thoughtson productivity vs effectiveness.

                    <span>Million makes creating user interfaces as easy as React, but with faster performance and smaller bundle size for the end user. By computing the user interface beforehand with a compiler, Million reduces the overhead of traditional Virtual DOM.
Okay cool… but why should I use Million if I can just use Preact if I need something a bit more lightweight?
While alternative libraries like Preact reduce bundle sizes by efficient code design, Million takes it a step further by leveraging compilation to make a quantum leap in improving bundle size and render speed.
Watch the video or get started with the docs.

                    <span>This week we’re joined again by Ben Ubois and we’re talking about RSS. Yes, RSS…the tech that never seems to die and yet so many of us rely on it daily. Ben is the creator of Feedbin, which is self-described as “a nice place to read on the web.” Ben is also the maker of a new app on iOS for people who like podcasts. It’s called Airshow and you can download it at airshow.fm. Ben catches us up on the state of Feedbin, we discuss the nine lives of RSS and its foundational utility for the indie web, the possibilities and short-comings of RSS, we get deep in the weeds on the Podcast 2.0 spec and the work being done on 
, and Ben also shares the details on his new app called Airshow.

We all get used to using the good old Python libraries, but it’s time say goodbye to os.path, random, pytz, namedtuple and many more obsolete Python libraries and start using the latest and greatest ones instead.

                    <span>Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a web worker, and off of the main thread. Its goal is to help speed up sites by dedicating the main thread to your code, and offloading third-party scripts to a web worker.
Even with a fast and highly tuned website following all of today’s best practices, it’s all too common for your performance wins to be erased the moment third-party scripts are added. By third-party scripts we mean code that is embedded within your site, but not directly under your control. A few examples include: analytics, metrics, ads, A/B testing, trackers, etc.
I learned of this library during our fascinating discussion with Miško Hevery on (next week’s) JS Party.

                    <span>Go 1.18 was a major release where we saw the introduction of generics into the language as well as other notables such as fuzzing and workspaces. With Go 1.19 slated to come out next month, one has to wonder what’s next. Are we in store to be blown away by new and major features like we saw in 1.18? Not exactly but there are still lots of improvements to be on the lookout for.
Joining Mat &amp; Johnny to touch on some of the most interesting ones is Carl Johnson, himself a contributor to the 1.19 release.

                    <span>Reading other people’s code is a sure-fire way to improve as a developer. But what about as a database designer? The same process applies!
This post by Shekhar Gulati is him sharing what he learned by applying that principle to GitLab’s schema.
I learnt a lot from the GitLab schema. They don’t blindly apply the same practices to all the table designs. Each table makes the best decision based on its purpose, the kind of data it stores, and its rate of growth.

                    <span>Sean Moriarity:
A common argument against using Nx for a new machine learning project is its perceived lack of a library/support for some common task that is available in Python. In this post, I’ll do my best to highlight areas where this is not the case, and compare and contrast Elixir projects with their Python equivalents. Additionally, I’ll discuss areas where the Elixir ecosystem still comes up short, and using Nx for a new project might not be the best idea.
Sean is a prominent member of the Elixir community, so that’s the perspective on display here, but it’s a thorough and well-reasoned comparison. He concludes:
While there are still many gaps in the Elixir ecosystem, the progress over the last year has been rapid. Almost every library I’ve mentioned in this post is less than two years old, and I suspect there will be many more projects to fill some of the gaps I’ve mentioned in the coming months.

LiteFS is a FUSE-based file system for replicating SQLite databases across a cluster of machines. It works as a passthrough file system that intercepts writes to SQLite databases in order to detect transaction boundaries and record changes on a per-transction level in LTX files.
I believe Ben was alluding to this (then unreleased) tool on his recent Ship It! appearance…

What does control of AI mean for nations, corporations, and universities?  What does control or access to AI mean for conflict and autonomy?  The world is changing rapidly, and the rate of change is accelerating.  Daniel and Chris look behind the curtain in the halls of power.

                    <span>John Goerzen built a computer for his 3yo, installed Debian on it, and set up a GUI for it.
The looks of shock I get from people when I explain, as if it’s perfectly natural, that my child has been able to log in by himself to a Linux shell since age 3, are amusing and astounding. Especially considering that it is really not that hard.
It’s not that hard, but it is so foreign to people that they’re quickly impressed by such things. Still, John decided to introduce his kids to a GUI eventually:
Jacob mastered the basics of xmonad really quickly. Alt-Shift-C to close a window. Alt-Shift-Q to quit back to the “big black screen”. Alt-Shift-Enter to get a terminal window.
We launched thunar (the XFCE file manager) and plugged in his camera. He had a good deal of fun looking at photos and videos from it. But then I dropped the true highlight of the day for him: I offered to install Tuxpaint for him. That’s probably his favorite program of all time.
Tux Paint!

We get into the details behind the tech and scaling of WeWork, comparisons of the fictional series on Apple TV+ called WeCrashed and how much of that is true. Then we move on to Wilco which is what has On’s full attention right now. Wilco has the potential to be the next big thing for developers to acquire new skills.

                    <span>This looks very opinionated with the tech it chooses (Node, Express, MongoDB, React, TypeScript). But if you like those choices, that probably means you’ll like what they’ve cooked up.
Payload gives you everything you need, but then steps back and lets you build what you want in JavaScript or TypeScript - with no unnecessary complexity brought by GUIs. You’ll understand how your CMS works because you will have written it exactly how you want it.
Bring your own Express server and do whatever you need on top of Payload. Payload doesn’t impose anything on you or your app.
Completely control the Admin panel by using your own React components. Swap out fields or even entire views with ease.
Use your data however and wherever you need thanks to auto-generated, yet fully extensible REST, GraphQL, and Local Node APIs.

                    <span>User Uptrenda asked HN about their favorite data structures, sharing their own to get it started:
I’ll start: bloom filters. Lets you test if a value is definitely NOT in a list of pre-stored values (or POSSIBLY in a list - with adjustable probability that influences storage of the values.)
Good use-case: routing. Say you have a list of 1 million IPs that are black listed. A trivial algorithm would be to compare every element of the set with a given IP. The time complexity grows with the number of elements. Not so with a bloom filter! A bloom filter is one of the few data structures whose time complexity does not grow with the number of elements due to the ‘keys’ not needing to be stored (‘search’ and ‘insert’ is based on the number of hash functions.)
The responses are numerous with a lot of signal, which is increasingly rare on the orange website these days. Worth a read!

                    <span>Gerhard’s transition to a senior engineer started 10 years ago, when he embraced the vim mindset, functional core &amp; imperative shell, and was inspired to seek simplicity in his code &amp; infrastructure. Most of it can be traced back to one person: Gary Bernhardt, the creator of Execute Program, Destroy all Software and the now famous Wat idea.
Few stick around long enough to understand the long-term impact of their decisions on production systems. Even fewer are able to talk about them as well as Gary does.

                    <span>This article confirms my biases because I’ve always despised every soft delete implementation I’ve come up with. Most of them have looked something like what the author describes:
the technique has some major downsides. The first is that soft deletion logic bleeds out into all parts of your code. All our selects look something like this:
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE id &#x3D; @id
    AND deleted_at IS NULL;

And forgetting that extra predicate on deleted_at can have dangerous consequences as it accidentally returns data that’s no longer meant to be seen.
ORMs help with this, but not enough. You set it as a default scope and then there’s that one time where you also want the deleted records so you come up with a custom query or dig into your ORM and try to find how to bypass the rule. Yuck!
He goes on to describe other problems as well. Maybe it’s all a big case of YAGNI?
Once again, soft deletion is theoretically a hedge against accidental data loss. As a last argument against it, I’d ask you to consider, realistically, whether undeletion is something that’s ever actually done.
When I worked at Heroku, we used soft deletion.
When I worked at Stripe, we used soft deletion.
At my job right now, we use soft deletion.
As far as I’m aware, never once, in ten plus years, did anyone at any of these places ever actually use soft deletion to undelete something.

Along the way, they acknowledge that some folks in the larger AI community are suggesting that sophisticated models may be approaching sentience, but together they pour cold water on that notion.  But they can’t seem to get away from DALL-E’s images of raccoons in space, and of course, who would want to?

A sobering statistic, but with a caveat: this only accounts for the 937 products that have their revenue verified by Stripe. The 5% is low, but that’s for a high bar of $100k/year. It gets worse:
A prevalent thinking is that making money as an indie developer is hard and most of the products end up with no revenue at all. Products on Indie Hackers seem to confirm this as more than 54% of the products are not making any revenue at all.
The post also breaks down the best performing product categories. ‘Wearables’ looks like a good one.
(We love the Indie Hackers community and know how hard it is to make it on your own. This post is not intended to denigrate anyone, just provide information.)

                    <span>Posted by Matthew Maurer and Mike Yu, Android team
   To help keep Android users’ DNS queries private, Android supports encrypted   DNS. In addition to existing support for DNS-over-TLS, Android now supports   DNS-over-HTTP/3 which has a number of improvements over DNS-over-TLS. 
  Most network connections begin with a DNS lookup. While transport security may   be applied to the connection itself, that DNS lookup has traditionally not   been private by default: the base DNS protocol is raw UDP with no encryption.   While the internet has migrated to TLS over time, DNS has a bootstrapping   problem. Certificate verification relies on the domain of the other party,   which requires either DNS itself, or moves the problem to DHCP (which may be   maliciously controlled). This issue is mitigate…</span>

                    <span>Matt Rickard, yes this Matt Rickard from episode #463 of The Changelog, shared some thoughts (an unordered list) about the forces acting on RSS.
He sets the stage by sharing a swath of think pieces written on the subject.
No technology other than RSS has had more think pieces written proclaiming the death of RSS (2006, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013) and the rebirth of RSS (2009, 2010, 2011, 2018, 2018, 2019).
Here are two points (of several shared) that stood out to me.
Substack has revitalized the blogging movement by giving away free hosting and email lists, and a business model for supporting writers. As email newsletters grow, RSS is a decent alternative to an increasingly cluttered email inbox.
Creator incentives work against RSS. The protocol does not benefit content creators because it doesn’t give them any insight into their audience (number of subscribers, emails, or other data).
What are your thoughts in his thoughts? What’s next for RSS?

                    <span>This isn’t the first attempt at making regular expressions more approachable, but it’s the first one I’ve seen that also brings type safety to the table. Example code:
import { createRegExp, exactly, oneOrMore, digit } from &#x27;magic-regexp&#x27;

// Quick-and-dirty semver
createRegExp(
  oneOrMore(digit)
    .as(&#x27;major&#x27;)
    .and(&#x27;.&#x27;)
    .and(oneOrMore(digit).as(&#x27;minor&#x27;))
    .and(exactly(&#x27;.&#x27;).and(oneOrMore(char).as(&#x27;patch&#x27;)).optionally())
)
// /(?(\d)+)\.(?(\d)+)(\.(?
(.)+))?/

                    <span>Testing distributed systems under hard failures like network partitions and instance termination is critical, but it’s also important we test them under less catastrophic conditions because this is what they most often experience. Comcast is a tool designed to simulate common network problems like latency, bandwidth restrictions, and dropped/reordered/corrupted packets.
It works by wrapping up some system tools in a portable(ish) way. On BSD-derived systems such as OSX, we use tools like ipfw and pfctl to inject failure. On Linux, we use iptables and tc. Comcast is merely a thin wrapper around these controls.
