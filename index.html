                    <span>elfshaker is a CLI tool written in the Rust programming language. It stores snapshots of directories into highly-compressed pack files and provides fast on-demand access to the stored files. It is particularly good for storing lots of similar files, for example object files from an incremental build.
They’ve had phenomenal results when using this with clang builds.

Hydrogen is their React framework for dynamic, contextual, and personalized e-commerce. And Oxygen is Shopify’s hosted V8 JavaScript worker runtime that leverages all of their platform with the hope of scaling millions of storefronts. We cover what developers can expect from the Hydrogen framework, Shopify’s big bet on React Server Components, the future of Shopify at scale with Hydrogen powered by Oxygen, and a world where merchants never have to think about the complexities of scaling infrastructure.

I created a GitHub action that auto-formats Changelog’s episode transcripts. Here’s how. 👇
My backstory 📖
This was my first meaningful code contribution to open source!
It was an awesome experience for me. I’m a hobby coder, and podcasts like The Changelog played a big role in my journey learning to code. This made it even more exciting for me when I came across an issue requesting a GitHub action to auto-improve Changelog’s transcripts while scouring for potential contributions during Hacktoberfest. It was a special chance…</span>

From research demos to AI that really works


I was first introduced to neural networks — computer systems that roughly imitate how biological brains accomplish tasks — as an undergrad in 1990. I did my senior thesis on using parallel computation to train neural networks. In those early days, I thought if we could 32X more compute power (using 32 processors at the time!), we could get neural networks to do impressive things. I was way off. It turns out …</span>

                    <span>The bulk of this post by Brett Cannon is a detailed argument that Python makes sense to select even for projects with known performance concerns, but I got my money’s worth from the concept in the title and opener:
… it dawned on me that the problem is people are not treating language selection as potential form of premature optimization: if you select a programming language based on your preconceived notions of how a language performs, you will never know if the language that might be a better, more productive fit for your developers would have actually worked out.

                    <span>Often software developers are encouraged to learn deeply. Know your language and framework of choice better. That’s all good, but there’s another side to learning that’s often overlooked. Knowing a little about a lot of things so you have less blind spots.
In the blog post we look at the importance of learning broadly and how to go about it.

                    <span>Property-based testing helps us write better tests, with less code, and greater coverage. This leads to more confidence in our code, and fewer bugs in our applications. But, as always, there’s a price. Property tests take more effort to write, and they take longer to run. But they’re worth it.

                    <span>Doug Turnbull breaks down a major difference between two beloved programming languages in how they handle iteration.
Python embraces for. Objects tell for how to work with them, and the for loop’s body processes what’s given back by the object. Ruby does the opposite. In Ruby, for itself (via each) is a method of the Object. The caller passes the body of the for loop to this method.
He goes on to give examples and explain why each approach might map to different developers’ brains… differently. Here’s a succinct summary, if you don’t have time for the deeper discussion:
In Ruby, the objects control the affordances. In Python, the language does.

&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; SUMMARY &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;
Upload capacity: 14.696 Mbps
Download capacity: 21.661 Mbps
Upload flows: 20
Download flows: 12
Responsiveness: Low (103 RPM)

What’s interesting about it is that it measures your upload and download in parallel by default, which is more aligned with real-world usage than running them back-to-back like other tests do.

                    <span>What was I doing the last time I was here?
We’re linking to the repo, but the idea is where it’s at. The code is a one-liner (if you’re using zsh)
grep -v &quot;jog&quot; ~/.zsh_history_ext | grep -a --color&#x3D;never &quot;${PWD}   &quot; | cut -f1 -d&quot;|&quot; | tail

Then you add this to your .zshrc
function zshaddhistory() {
	echo &quot;${1%%$&#x27;\n&#x27;}|${PWD}   &quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.zsh_history_ext
}

Now you’re all set for the next time you need to jog your memory!

                    <span>Sound career &amp;&amp; life advice by Adam Keys:
It’s possibly the best advice for managers I’ve given so far. When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!
I have to remind myself of this when I’m rushing. It’s faster to ping someone to arrange a synchronous talk than it is to write out what I need to say and cover all the bases. But that doesn’t give me license to skip all the context. Broad strokes are okay. An information vacuum is not okay.
Hmm I probably have to work on this one…

It all started with Oleg’s tweet back in July, in which he was promoting Akihiro Kiuchi’s work on Jenkins monitoring with OpenTelemetry. This was done in the context of Google’s Summer of Code - a link to Akihiro’s demo is in the show notes.
As you may remember from episode 20, instrumenting our changelog.com pipeline is on Gerhard’s mind, and this conversation helped him clarify a few things. If you are thinking of instrumenting your CI/CD pipeline with OpenTelemetry, this episode is for you.

                    <span>Svyatoslav Kryukov on the Evil Martian blog:
Ruby is awesome. We love its readability, flexibility, and developer-centric nature. Still, here at Mars, we also love Go because it has its own sense of simplicity and magic, too. Simply put, Go holds advantages over Ruby in some aspects: it’s faster, statically typed, and comes with cool concurrency primitives out of the box. This being said, some intrepid readers might find themselves grappling with a seemingly reasonable question: if Go is so darn good, why don’t we just write everything with it?
Read this tale and learn to write Go in Ruby, gaining the ability to modify Ruby exactly as you desire.

In recent years, continuous fuzzing has become an essential part of the software development lifecycle. By feeding unexpected or random data into a program, fuzzing catches bugs that would otherwise slip through the most thorough manual checks and provides coverage that would take staggering human effort to replicate. NIST’s guidelines for software verification, recently released in response to the White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, specify fuzzing among the minimum standard requirements for code verification.
Today, we are excited to announce ClusterFuzzLite, a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before. With just a few line…</span>

You can deep dive into the NGINX documentation right now OR you can use this tool to check how NGINX works, observe how your inputs are affecting the output, and generate the best config for your specific use-case (in parallel you can also still use the docs).

For years now, blogs, webinars and white papers have opined that GitOps is the Next Big Thing, yet here a respected voice in the field is saying to tread carefully. So what gives? Do we need to pump the brakes? Is GitOps just a lot of unwarranted hype? Or is there a missing piece of the puzzle here? As in so many things, the answer is: It’s complicated. GitOps can be transformative for some teams, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.

                    <span>Avdi Grimm kicks off a new series of posts (that I’m quite excited about) on the various parts that go into a “banana stand” business by deftly wielding a classic Arrested Development gag and telling the tale of how he got his stand started:
I’m a software developer by trade. I’ve slung code either as an employee or as an independent consultant for over two decades. But around ten years ago, I started selling e-books about programming. At the time it was a way to recoup the time and energy I had sunk into researching conference talks, as well as a way to expand on the topics of those talks.
E-books expanded to screencasts, and then to courses. I found myself with a diversified product income that sometimes rivaled or even exceeded what I could expect from a developer’s salary.
As a result, gaps between gigs haven’t felt like “unemployment” for a long time. Instead, they are opportunities to work on my education business. Recently, a major gig I’d been looking forward to fell through at the last second. Once I worked through the disappointment, I was like: “welp, there’s always money in the banana stand!”
The first component of your banana stand: a mailing list

                    <span>This is the first time I’ve heard of a reverse dictionary, but now that I have… so cool!
Opposite to a regular (forward) dictionary that provides definitions for query words, a reverse dictionary returns words semantically matching the query descriptions.
Ever had a word on the tip of your tongue and you Just. Can’t. Think of it?! Reverse dictionary!

                    <span>This is a great post byu Andy Kimball on what they mean when they say CockroachDB is now serverless:
Serverless means you don’t have to think about servers. Of course there are servers hard at work handling your application’s requests, but that’s our problem, not yours. We do all the hard work behind the scenes of allocating, configuring, and maintaining the servers. Instead of paying for servers, you pay for the requests that your application makes to the database and the storage that your data consumes.
How they got here:
Before now, a single physical CockroachDB cluster was intended for dedicated use by a single user or organization. That is called single-tenancy. Over the past several CockroachDB releases, we’ve quietly been adding multi-tenancy support…
How they scale it:
Within every Serverless cluster, there is an autoscaler component that is responsible for determining the ideal number of SQL pods that should be assigned to each tenant, whether that be one, many, or zero.
And what it all means for Cockroach’s users.

                    <span>Rachel by the Bay:
There’s a post going around tonight about how someone forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full table scans (or something like that). The rub is that instead of just being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy vendor system charged by the row or somesuch. So, by scanning the whole table, they touched all of those rows, and oh hey, massive amounts of money just set ablaze!
The usual venues are discussing it, and I get the impression some people have the wrong approach to this. I want to describe a truly bad database schema I encountered, and then tell you a little about what it did to the system performance.
A fun story with an excellent twist at the end.

One of mine around coding goes back to college in the 70s. I learned about parsing arithmetic expressions and putting them into Reverse Polish notation. And then, I figured out that, just like multiplication is repeated addition, division is repeated subtraction.

                    <span>Today we’re joined by Shawn “swyx” Wang, also known as just “swyx” — and we’re talking about his interesting path to becoming a software developer, what it means to “learn in public” and how he’s been able to leverage that process to not only level up his skills and knowlege, but to also rapidly advance his career. We cover Swyx’s recent writing on the light and dark side of the API economy — something he calls “living above or below the API,” his thoughts on Cloudflare eating the cloud by playing Go instead of Chess, and we also talk about the work he’s doing at Temporal and how’s taking his frontend skills to the backend.

                    <span>Brian Di Croce writes a few thousand words saying SLOW DOWN in different ways. And it’s good!
Don’t race yourself to a burnout or a weaker desire to work in this creative field. Slow down. Know what you’re doing before you start typing the first line of code. Make sure that you understand what needs to be built. If what needs to be built isn’t 100% sure by anyone, then accept the reality that it might have to be built incrementally. It’s not the ideal, but sometimes it’s real.
If you’ll allow me to pick one nit with this post: successful software is rarely finished. And if you’re making successful software you likely won’t finish either. So, I would suggest wording this slightly different: Slow down to go faster 😉

                    <span>This is a short post by long-time open source maintainer Chris Manson about commitment to tasks in the open source world and how life always takes priority over dev.
We always need to keep in mind that most open source contributions are given from people that are opting to give up their spare time (usually for free) and the level of expectation can never come anywhere close to the sort of relationship that an employer might have with an employee or contractor.

Recently, TimescaleDB published a blog comparing ClickHouse &amp; TimescaleDB using timescale/tsbs, a timeseries benchmarking framework. I have some experience with PostgreSQL and ClickHouse but never got the chance to play with TimescaleDB. Some of the claims about TimescaleDB made in their post are very bold, that made me even more curious. I thought it’d be a great opportunity to try it out and see if those claims are really true.

                    <span>The team’s goal is to become “the de-facto open-source alternative to MongoDB.” Here’s why:
MongoDB is a life-changing technology for many developers, empowering them to build applications faster than using relational databases. Its easy-to-use and well-documented drivers make MongoDB one of the easiest to use database solutions available. However, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots, changing the license to SSPL - making it unusable for many open source and commercial projects.
Most MongoDB users are not in need of many of the advanced features offered by MongoDB; however, they are in need of an open-source database solution. Recognizing this, MangoDB is here to fill the gap by providing an alternative.
This is currently a proof of concept. The concept: a proxy that converts Mongo’s wire protocol to SQL and stores everything in PostgreSQL. Fascinating idea! Will it work?

                    <span>The linked post is about a new book by Jeremy Wagner, but I just wanted to highlight the excellent aside on book writing by Chris Coyier near the end:
Write a blog post first, or maybe a whole bunch of blog posts. That’ll prove you clearly have words to say about this. Plus it will get the energy of your idea into the world. You might get feedback and constructive insights on the idea as it is shared. Then, hopefully, you can turn that blog post into a talk. That’ll really get you thinking deeply about your idea while getting even more comfortable with the idea of sharing it clearly. And, if all goes well, turn all of that into a book!
Looks like Jeremy did just that.

                    <span>City transportation is crucial to connecting residents to education, employment and essential services. At the same time, the transportation sector is where global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are rising the quickest.
In 2018, we launched the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE) in collaboration with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy (GCoM). As part of Google&#x27;s most ambitious decade of climate action, we’ve committed to helping more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions per year by 2030 and beyond. With EIE, cities have free access to Google’s unique mapping data and insights so they can make sustainable decisions regarding cleaner transport policies and infrastructure programs. Since launching EIE, we’ve seen more ci…</span>

                    <span>Vladimir Dementyev shares a deep dive into some necessary profiling he did on one of the Go services and how he finally figured out what was going wrong:
Here’s a question: how can we see what’s happening inside an arbitrary Go process? Or, more precisely, how can we see what all the goroutines are doing at any given moment? If we could crack that, it could help us figure out why they’re not processing our requests.

                    <span>Have you heard? The just-released 12th version of Next.js uses a Rust-based compiler (swc) to achieve ~3x faster local refreshes and ~5x faster production builds.
Compilation using Rust is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default using Next.js 12, replacing transforming JavaScript and TypeScript files. This meant we had to port the Babel transformations in Next.js to Rust, including a brand new CSS parser in Rust used to implement the styled-jsx transform.
With the increased popularity of Rust and Go-based JS tooling, could there be a future where we don’t use any JavaScript to build our JavaScript apps? 🤔

                    <span>This post by Pat Shaugnessy echoes Matt Rickard’s sentiment that we discussed in-depth on The Changelog 463:
The best way to learn a new programming language, just like a human language, is from example. To learn how to write code you first need to read someone else’s code. But who is the best person to learn from? Which code should we read? Where should we look to find it?
Pat was looking into Crystal and found its standard library to be excellent reading. I think his conclusion generalizes pretty well, with caveats.
Older languages often have areas of the standard library that were written prior to new language features, so they are no longer idiomatic.
Some standard library code is necessarily low-level, even dipping into the underlying language or using esoteric features. This can make for some tough sledding.
Standard library code is used so frequently that it’s often highly optimized for performance, which reduces readability.

                    <span>This essay from Mary Rose Cook explains how Git works. Who should read this? Anyone who wants a deeper understanding of Git.
The essay assumes you understand Git well enough to use it to version control your projects. It focuses on the graph structure that underpins Git and the way the properties of this graph dictate Git’s behavior. Looking at fundamentals, you build your mental model on the truth rather than on hypotheses constructed from evidence gathered while experimenting with the API. This truer model gives you a better understanding of what Git has done, what it is doing, and what it will do.
(If you’d rather absorb the same information as a talk, you can watch this video instead.)

                    <span>These teardowns are always an enjoyable read. This one is particular interesting because of the large upgrade this year’s line of pro laptops is and how Apple appears to be returning to form with their design decisions. Here’s the lede:
We’ve still got a long way to go with disassembly, but this new MacBook Pro has, at the very least, the first reasonably DIY-friendly battery replacement procedure since 2012.

                    <span>Brandon Quakkelaar:
I am not a big social media guy anymore. Over the last few years I’ve been actively avoiding it. I’m not a fan of each platform’s privacy concerns, and users need to be very cautious to avoid flamewars and infinite doomscrolling. If we aren’t careful, social media’s default state seems to devolve into just destroying trust and goodwill. I prefer society in real life.
However, avoiding social media means that we lose a lot of interesting articles, funny memes, and informative videos that are shared on those platforms.
In case you haven’t guessed it, he goes on to prescribe RSS as the solution to this problem. I have a half-written blog post titled, “RSS is the indie social network we’ve been looking for”… so I tend to agree with him.

                    <span>When I reflect on the past two decades of computer science research, few things inspire me more than the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the field of artificial intelligence.


In 2001, some colleagues sitting just a few feet away from me at Google realized they could use an obscure technique called machine learning to help correct misspelled Search queries. (I remember I was amazed to see it work on everything from “ayambic pitnamiter” to “unnblevaiabel”). Today, AI augments many of the things that we do, whether that’s helping you capture a nice selfie, or providing more useful search results, or warning hundreds of millions of people when and where flooding will occur. Twenty years of advances in research have helped elevate AI from a promising idea to an indispensable aid in billions…</span>

                    <span>Today Adam is joined by Evan Kaplan, CEO of InfluxData. Evan’s journey to become the CEO was not by way of founder, in this company. Evan has founded several companies in the past, and he’s been in a CEO position for more than 22 years. But InfluxData was founded by Paul Dix, and Paul knew years ago that his role (best role?) was to lead the technical and product direction of the company, which lead him to Evan. Today we share that story as well as a glimpse into operating the business that built the defacto platform for building time series applications with deep roots in open source.

It has become quite absurd to argue that remoteness has to mean becoming a less visible and valued contributor to your organization. I hope this post can help you convince anyone who might still believe that communicating remotely still has to be a pain.

                    <span>The New Stack’s Jennifer Riggins covering Kubecon+CloudNativeCon 2021:
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has more than 138,000 contributors making over 7 million contributions to more than 100 open source projects. It’s reasonable that getting started in open source would feel overwhelming — to say the least. So how do you get started as a contributor to cloud native projects? How do you find a mentor or guide to help you along?
She draws many solid takeaways from a panel that discussed this exact topic at the event. This quote from Grafana’s Uchechukwu Obasi is spectacular:
“I think open source really changed my life,” Obasi said. “I’m African, I live in Africa, but having the opportunity to work on software that impacts millions of lives, it’s an opportunity that I never take for granted. If open source can change my life, it can change yours too.”

Outsourcing operations to third-party vendors has become a popular business strategy as it allows organizations to save money and increase operational efficiency. While these are positives for business operations, they do create significant security risks. These vendors have access to critical systems and customer data and so their security posture becomes equally as important.

We’re betting that the Nix project will improve performance across the board, sidestep a whole slew of bugs for our community, and let any Replit user build and publish programming environments.
For a primer convo on Nix, (re)visit our conversation with Domen Kozar on The Changelog.

                    <span>The curl project’s source code has been hosted on GitHub since March 2010. I wrote a blog post in 2013 about what I missed from the service back then and while it has improved significantly since then, there are still features I miss and flaws I think can be fixed. For this reason, I’ve created … Continue reading a github wishlist →</span>

                    <span>Robby Russell is back on The Changelog after more than 10 years to catch us up on all things Oh My Zsh — a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zshell configuration. It comes bundled with plugins, themes, and can be easily customized and contributed to, because hey, that’s how open source works. In this episode Robby gives us a glimpse into the passion and the struggle of being an open source software maintainer.

                    <span>There are many great articles written about the Seam Carving algorithm already, but I couldn’t resist the temptation to explore this elegant, powerful, and yet simple algorithm on my own, and to write about my personal experience with it. Another point that drew my attention (as a creator of javascript-algorithms repo) was the fact that Dynamic Programming (DP) approach might be smoothly applied to solve it. And, if you’re like me and still on your “learning algorithms” journey, this algorithmic solution may enrich your personal DP arsenal.
