                    <span>This week we’re joined by Mike Riley and we’re talking about his book Portable Python Projects (Running your home on a Raspberry Pi). We breakdown the details of the latest Raspberry Pi hardware, various automation ideas from the book, why Mike prefers Python for scripting on a Raspberry Pi, and of course why the Raspberry Pi makes sense for home labs concerned about data security.
Use the code PYPROJECTS to get a 35% discount on the book. That code is valid for approximately 60 days after the episode’s publish date.

Over the next few months, we’ll be completing the OpenJS Foundation’s incubation program checklist, including transferring the Jest domain, repo, website, and other assets to OpenJS. We’ll also be updating the code of conduct and contributor license agreement.
Additionally, as part of this move, we will be publishing a project charter and creating new governance policies that will document the process for gaining commit access, as well as our leadership selection process.

                    <span>Firefox uses a multi-process model for additional security and stability while browsing: Web Content (such as HTML/CSS and Javascript) is rendered in separate processes that are isolated from the rest of the operating system and managed by a privileged parent process. This way, the amount of control gained by an attacker that exploits a bug in a content process is limited. In this article, we would like to dive a bit further into the latest major milestone we have reached: Win32k Lockdown, which greatly reduces the capabilities of the content process when running on Windows.

Nearly 24 years ago, Google started with two graduate students, one product, and a big mission: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission.
The progress we&#x27;ve made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O.
Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them.

From the beginning, we set out to connect words in your search to words on a page so we could make the web’s information more accessible and useful. Over 20 years later, as the web changes, and the ways people consume information expand from text to images to videos and more — the one constant is that language remains a surprisingly powerful tool for understanding information.


In recent years, we’ve seen an incredible acceleration in the field of natural language understanding. While our systems still don’t understand language the way people do, they’re increasingly able to spot patterns in information, identify comp…</span>

                    <span>Google Maps helps over one billion people navigate and explore.

                    <span>For years, Google Translate has helped break down language barriers and connect communities all over the world. And we want to make this possible for even more people — especially those whose languages aren’t represented in most technology. So today we’ve added 24 languages to Translate, now supporting a total of 133 used around the globe.
Over 300 million people speak these newly added languages — like Mizo, used by around 800,000 people in the far northeast of India, and Lingala, used by over 45 million people across Central Africa. As part of this update, Indigenous languages of the Americas (Quechua, Guarani and Aymara) and an English dialect (Sierra Leonean Krio) have also been added to Translate for the first time.

                    <span>Today at I/O we released the Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale in partnership with Harvard professor and sociologist Dr. Ellis Monk. The MST Scale, developed by Dr. Monk, is a 10-shade scale designed to be more inclusive of the spectrum of skin tones in our society. We’ll be incorporating the MST Scale into various Google products over the coming months, and we are openly releasing the scale so that anyone can use it for research and product development.
The MST Scale is an important next step in a collective effort to improve skin tone inclusivity in technology. For Google, it will help us make progress in our commitment to image equity and improving representation across our products. And in releasing the MST Scale for all to use, we hope to make it easier for others to do the same, so we can l…</span>

                    <span>I love when software engineers share their career/life choices and the reasoning behind them so others can benefit from their perspective, like this one on bucket filling:
Somebody once described balance to me as three buckets filled with water. One for career, a second for physical health, and a third for social and family life. At any point, one bucket might be running low. But as long as the overall water level is high enough, things should be fine.
Scott’s choice to join a startup seems odd given his reason for leaving Google, but:
So: am I happier? Undoubtedly yes.
I work more hours. I’m more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now. But what I do makes a difference that I can see. Progress feels 10x faster.
Most surprising is that I have more energy. It’s easier to find motivation to get back in the gym. I have more energy in social situations.
Working more hours sounds like tipping the work/life balance in the wrong direction, but excitement about your work certainly changes the calculus. He’s happier now, so that’s great!

Object-oriented, cute, really popular, and a bit naive. Had a bit of Fry grafted onto herself for a while. Also had a thing with Bender. And Zapp. Easy going, but doesn’t do well in difficult situations, falls over easily.
Bender is Shell. Fry is Perl. If you care at all for his reasoning, you’ve already clicked through!

So let’s dig into the tools we’re building to better secure your data, enhance your privacy and increase trust in the apps and experiences on your devices.

Every year, security technologies improve: browsers get better, encryption becomes ubiquitous on the Web, authentication becomes stronger. But phishing persistently remains a threat (as shown by a recent phishing attack on the U.S. Department of Labor) because users retain the ability to log into their online accounts, often with a simple password, from anywhere in the world. It’s why today at I/O we announced new ways we’re reducing the risks of phishing by: scaling phishing protections to Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, continuing to auto enroll people in 2-Step Verification and more. This blog will deep dive into the method of phishing and how it has evolved today.

                    <span>This week Sid Sijbrandij Co-founder and CEO of GitLab is back talking with Adam about all the details of their massive IPO last October 2021. To set the stage, this episode was recorded on Feb 1, 2022. During the show Adam mentioned they IPO’d at a $13B market cap, but they actually ended their opening day at approximately $15B. That’s a massive win for open source, GitLab, Sid, and the rest of the team. For loyal listeners you know we’ve had Sid on this show before, so of course we had to get him back on the show post-IPO to get all the details of this new journey.

For those who haven’t used Emacs, it’s something you’ll likely hate, but may love. It’s sort of a Rube Goldberg machine the size of a house that, at first glance, performs all the functions of a toaster. That hardly sounds like an endorsement, but the key phrase is “at first glance.” Once you grok Emacs, you realize that it’s a thermonuclear toaster that can also serve as the engine for… well, just about anything you want to do with text.

                    <span>Lots of cool stuff for Markdown authors in April’s VS Code release. Namely:
drag and drop files into the editor to create a Markdown link
find all references to header|links|files|urls inside of Markdown
rename headers|links inside Markdown (and propagate the changes)
rename Markdown files (and propagate to all references)
The Dendron team is excited because their primary vault hosts over 400k lines of Markdown 🤯
VS Code, and IDEs more broadly, help developers manage large code bases by making available tools to leverage and manipulate the syntax of programming languages. By shifting some of this tooling to markdown, can we do the same for large Markdown repositories?

                    <span>I’ve long been fascinated by literate programming (the art of writing code as if it was a novel), but it’s been awhile since I’ve seen a good example of in practice. Here’s a good one:
I wanted to showcase the BDD-inspired low-tech solution I came up with via a toy project, demonstrating a small but significant programming task, broken down as series of design-implementation cycles.
Wordle is a perfect target: it’s a small codebase, with a half dozen features to string together into a useable game.
This story has five chapters and a satisfying conclusion:
This project was my first foray into literate programming at this scale, an attempt to bring together all the good ideas of TDD, modern Python development, Gherkin usage for requirements traceability purposes (without overly zealous extremes of Cucumber automation). All these ideas were until now scattered, implemented each without the others in different places, and this project fuses them into something I hope is more valuable than the sum of its parts.

Woody leads Mob Programming workshops, he’s a speaker on agile related topics, and coaches and guides orgs interested in creating an environment where people can do their best work. We talk through it all and we even get some amazing advice from Woody’s dad. We define what Mob Programming is and why it’s so effective. Is it a rigid process or can teams flex to make it work for them? How to introduce mob programming to a team. What kind of groundwork is necessary? And of course, are mob programming’s virtues diminished by remote teams in virtual-only settings?

                    <span>Andraž Bajt:
Basic premise is: browsers are great at navigating pages, let’s leverage that by serving users directly with HTML. This already gives you half-decent pages but you can go further and sprinkle on some sugar. A bit of JS. Instead of reinventing the world in JS let’s try to really use what modern browsers provide natively and then push just a bit forward.
Is the pendulum starting to swing away from SPAs/client-side rendering and back toward MPAs/server-side rendering? Will we ever find balance somewhere in the middle?

The software supply chain starts with the developer. Developer accounts are frequent targets for social engineering and account takeover, and protecting developers from these types of attacks is the first and most critical step toward securing the supply chain…
Today, as part of a platform-wide effort to secure the software ecosystem through improving account security, we’re announcing that GitHub will require all users who contribute code on GitHub.com to enable one or more forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) by the end of 2023.
This is a big step in the right direction and their new(ish) 2FA for GitHub Mobile feature helps make the burden not as cumbersome as it might be otherwise.

                    <span>Some years back I applied to join IBM’s grad scheme, there was a peculiar stage to the process I’ve not seen elsewhere. It was during the onsite day, where a batch of 20 or so applicants were put through various tests in an IBM office. They called it the “group test”; around 8 of us were led to a room and asked to solve a puzzle together.
You can probably see where this story is headed… (see also)

                    <span>This week Peer Richelsen, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Cal.com, joins the show to talk about building the “Stripe for Time” — with a grand mission to connect a billion people by 2031 through calendar scheduling. Cal has grown from an open-source side project to one of the fastest-growing commercial open source companies. We get into all the details — what it means to be an open source Calendly alternative, how they quantify connecting a Billion people by 2031, where there’s room for innovation in the scheduling space, and why being community first is part of their secret sauce.

I was working on bioinformatics a few years ago and was amazed by those single-word bash commands which are much faster than my dull scripts, time saved through learning command-line shortcuts and scripting.
Recent years I am working on cloud computing and I keep recording those useful commands here. Not all of them is oneliner, but I put effort on making them brief and swift. I am mainly using Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, RedHat, Linux Mint, Mac and CentOS, sorry if the commands don’t work on your system.

                    <span>Today we talk to Mark Ericksen about all the things that we could be doing on the new platform - this is a follow-up to episode 50.
Mark specialises in Elixir, he hosts the Thinking Elixir podcast, and he also helps make Fly.io the best place to run Phoenix apps, such as changelog.com. In the interest of holding our new platform right, we thought that it would be a great idea to talk to someone that does this all day, every day, for many years now.
We touch up on how to run database migrations safely, and how to upgrade our application config to the latest Phoenix version. We also talked about some of the more advanced platform features that we may want to start leveraging, like the multi-region PostgreSQL.

                    <span>The coolest thing about this story is that the entire endeavor was apparently prompted by a random developer tweet! If you’ve ever wondered what all goes in to opening the source of historic software products like this one:
This code was restored from the Microsoft corporate archives and cleared for release.
Developer names and aliases were removed, with the exception of current employees who worked on the original release who consented to keeping their names in place
The archive consisted of several CDs, some of which were for alternate builds or products, and have been excluded
The code does not build with today’s engineering tools, and is released as-is.

You’ll learn about a cool compiler optimization called “string interning”, which is used in many languages. Also, you will understand what happens when (almost any) interpreter runs your code, take a look at the AST and take a peak at the symbols interpretation at the low level.

                    <span>Since TypeScript doesn’t follow SemVer itself, TS libraries which do want to follow SemVer need both high-level guidance about how to do that and detailed analysis of the corner cases to watch out for as well as ways to mitigate breaking changes from TS.
This doc is a (beta!) specification of SemVer for managing changes to TypeScript types, including when the TS compiler makes breaking changes in its type-checking and type emit across a “minor” release.

                    <span>Spacedrive helps you organize your files across many devices in one place. Here’s the motivation:
Many of us have multiple cloud accounts, drives that aren’t backed up and data at risk of loss. We depend on cloud services like Google Photos and iCloud, but are locked in with limited capacity and almost zero interoperability between services and operating systems. Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device ecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic, permanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long outlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute control over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.

                    <span>This is alpha software, but it seems pretty low risk to give it a try.
Wireit works with npm run, it doesn’t replace it. To configure an NPM script for Wireit, move the command into a new wireit section of your package.json, and replace the original script with the wireit command.
Now when you run npm run build, Wireit upgrades the script to be smarter and more efficient.

                    <span>This post by Chris de la Iglesia starts off very down on blockchains, but ends up not so down after all:
We are entering a new world with a new focus on giving users control over their data, their identity, and their systems. We are building distributed filesystems, distributed identity, and yes, blockchains. I think oftentimes we end up seeing only the blockchain technology due to the headlines and the financial investment, but distributed systems as a whole are taking off in a big, big way.

                    <span>The second jq alternative we’ve discovered this week! (first here)
jq is hard to use. There are alternatives like fq and zq, but they still make you learn a new programming language. Im tired of learning new programming languages.
gq is not optimized for speed, flexibility or beauty. gq is optimized for minimal learning/quick usage. gq understands that you don’t use it constantly, you use it once a month and then forget about it. So when you come back to it, gq will be easy to relearn. Just use the builtin library just like you would any other go project and you’re done. No unfamiliar syntax or operations, or surprising limits. Thats it.
I don’t know if Go is a great fit for this use-case, but if you already know it well… makes sense.

                    <span>Posted by Caleb Brown, Open Source Security Team 


Despite open source software’s essential role in all software built today, it’s far too easy for bad actors to circulate malicious packages that attack the systems and users running that software. Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute. As a result, malicious packages like ua-parser-js, and node-ipc are regularly uploaded to popular repositories despite their best efforts, with sometimes devastating consequences for users.

                    <span>The latest Common Voice dataset, released today, has achieved a major milestone: More than 20,000 hours of open-source speech data that anyone, anywhere can use. The dataset has nearly doubled in the past year. Mozilla’s Common Voice seeks to change the language technology ecosystem by supporting communities to collect voice data for the creation of voice-enabled applications for their own languages.

We will cover zq’s performance in a future article, but to cut to the chase here, zq is almost always at least a bit faster than jq when processing JSON inputs
Almost always at least a bit faster is not something you’re likely to notice in practice.

I know you’re going to be tempted to reply with “you’re using it wrong” - but I’m not. This is how I like to use my computer. And it is clear that the MacBook isn’t my computer - it is Apple’s. (OK, OK! It belongs to my employer!)
Some of his grievances like window snapping and moving/removing UI elements can be alleviated with 3rd-party solutions, but he’s not wrong that the operating system doesn’t provide these features.

It’s a golden age of emulation. Between increasing CPU power, WebAssembly, and retrocomputing being so popular The New York Times is covering it, it’s never been easier to relive your 80s / 90s / 2000s nostalgia. Projects like v86 make it easy to run your chosen old operating system in the browser. My heritage being of the classic Mac line, I was curious what the easiest to use emulation option was in the modern era…
Here’s a video demo of what resulted: a full-featured classic 68K Mac in your browser.

Earlier this year he wrote a blog post titled “Practical Guide to Solving Hard Problems,” and a lot of what he had to say really resonated with us. The premise is simple — if you have to write some code that you’re just not sure how to write…what do you do? What are the practical steps that you can take when you’re feeling stumped? Today’s show goes deep on that subject…practical ways to solve hard problems and ship your best work.

                    <span>Let’s be honest: The current generation of robotic lawn mowers sucks. Basically all of these bots drive in a random direction until they hit the border of the lawn, rotate for a randomized duration and repeat. I think we can do better!
Therefore, we have disassembled the cheapest off-the-shelf robotic mower we could find (YardForce Classic 500) and were surprised that the hardware itself is actually quite decent.
The bot itself is surprisingly high quality and doesn’t need to be changed at all. We just need some better software in there.
Here’s an overview video that explains the entire idea.

                    <span>With the recent events relating to Google Analytics platform, it’s becoming very clear that the time has come for many of us to migrate from Google Analytics to different platforms.
In this article we will go over both the “Why?”, so that you can make an informed decision whether you need to migrate of not, as well as the “How?” of migrating from Google Analytics - that is, quickly and easily taking your data and moving to different analytics platform without too much hassle.

It can track memory allocations in Python code, in native extension modules, and in the Python interpreter itself. It can generate several different types of reports to help you analyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a library to perform more fine-grained profiling tasks.
It has a lot of nice outputs so you can grok what’s going on.

The system delivered 16 millions of orders in 10 years, and 4.5 million in the last year alone. All the numbers are going up, and there is only so much that a single PHP monolith deployed as VM images can handle. So how do you even start thinking about the architectural improvements, and inspire everyone involved to move towards better?
We encourage you to look at the architectural diagrams in the show notes, especially the 10 year roadmap, and ask Alex for a blog post follow-up. While today’s episode was a good conversation starter, there is a lot that we did not h…</span>

AMP harms users’ privacy, security and internet experience, and just as bad, AMP helps Google further monopolize and control the direction of the Web.
The Brave team is really doubling down on privacy and security. I don’t think that strategy would’ve won users a few years ago, but in 2022 and beyond…

                    <span>This guide by Josh Comeau is Josh doing what Josh does so well: taking complex/arcane/technical topics and making them approachable &amp; fun for his audience.
It takes years of practice to become a terminal guru, but here’s the good news: we can take a shortcut. We don’t really need to know 98% of the stuff you can do with a terminal. If we focus on the most-important critical fundamentals, we should be able to become comfortable with the command line in a remarkably short amount of time. ✨
That’s what this blog post is all about.

                    <span>I thought Ali and Jen had some excellent advice in this segment of our JS Party episode on web dev for beginners, so I’m re-sharing it here in hopes that you might share it with people you know who may be stuck in the early phases of their web development path.
I also like what I had to say (imagine that!)
One thing that is true about software development in general… is that it’s actually really hard. And we need to just say that. Because you’re gonna hit bumps. You’re gonna hit walls. And some people will power through those walls and other people won’t, and that’s just the way life is…
But I think having something real that you want to exist… having a real project that you want to see into the world helps you get through those moments.

                    <span>Supabase CTO Ant Wilson walks through the pros &amp; cons of open sourcing your startup and why he believes the answer to the question in the headline is (probably) “yes”
Open-sourcing Supabase ended up surprising us in many ways. Many people imagine that maintaining your business in public might be burdensome - but the opposite is true. There are many unexpected upsides that have made building Supabase - the product and the company - easier.
While some of this advice comes from our lens as a Dev Tools or PaaS company, most of it will apply to any software company.

                    <span>Sounds like Jacob Kaplan-Moss isn’t the only hiring manager who’s keen on the reverse code review:
When hiring developers, there are many things we are looking for, but over the years I have found that raw coding ability is easily the most important quality to look for.   I can quickly train a person to have knowledge in some domain, but I’ve never seen raw coding ability come from anything other than personal commitment to extensive and deep practice.   Because of this, I have found that some methods work better than others to discover talent.
… instead of writing code, consider instead having the candidate read existing code and talk about what it does and how it works. This offers some powerful advantages:
The advantages in brief:
Reading probes the most fundamental skills
Reading code is way more efficient than writing.
Reading puts candidates at ease compared to writing code.
Click through for the details and how to put this in to practice.
