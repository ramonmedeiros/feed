                    <span>With the recent events relating to Google Analytics platform, it’s becoming very clear that the time has come for many of us to migrate from Google Analytics to different platforms.
In this article we will go over both the “Why?”, so that you can make an informed decision whether you need to migrate of not, as well as the “How?” of migrating from Google Analytics - that is, quickly and easily taking your data and moving to different analytics platform without too much hassle.

                    <span>From the engineering team at Bloomberg:
It can track memory allocations in Python code, in native extension modules, and in the Python interpreter itself. It can generate several different types of reports to help you analyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a library to perform more fine-grained profiling tasks.
It has a lot of nice outputs so you can grok what’s going on.

The system delivered 16 millions of orders in 10 years, and 4.5 million in the last year alone. All the numbers are going up, and there is only so much that a single PHP monolith deployed as VM images can handle. So how do you even start thinking about the architectural improvements, and inspire everyone involved to move towards better?
We encourage you to look at the architectural diagrams in the show notes, especially the 10 year roadmap, and ask Alex for a blog post follow-up. While today’s episode was a good conversation starter, there is a lot that we did not h…</span>

                    <span>Brave is rolling out a new feature called De-AMP, which allows Brave users to bypass Google-hosted AMP pages, and instead visit the content’s publisher directly. AMP harms users’ privacy, security and internet experience, and just as bad, AMP helps Google further monopolize and control the direction of the Web.
The Brave team is really doubling down on privacy and security. I don’t think that strategy would’ve won users a few years ago, but in 2022 and beyond…

                    <span>This guide by Josh Comeau is Josh doing what Josh does so well: taking complex/arcane/technical topics and making them approachable &amp; fun for his audience.
It takes years of practice to become a terminal guru, but here’s the good news: we can take a shortcut. We don’t really need to know 98% of the stuff you can do with a terminal. If we focus on the most-important critical fundamentals, we should be able to become comfortable with the command line in a remarkably short amount of time. ✨
That’s what this blog post is all about.

                    <span>I thought Ali and Jen had some excellent advice in this segment of our JS Party episode on web dev for beginners, so I’m re-sharing it here in hopes that you might share it with people you know who may be stuck in the early phases of their web development path.
I also like what I had to say (imagine that!)
One thing that is true about software development in general… is that it’s actually really hard. And we need to just say that. Because you’re gonna hit bumps. You’re gonna hit walls. And some people will power through those walls and other people won’t, and that’s just the way life is…
But I think having something real that you want to exist… having a real project that you want to see into the world helps you get through those moments.

                    <span>Supabase CTO Ant Wilson walks through the pros &amp; cons of open sourcing your startup and why he believes the answer to the question in the headline is (probably) “yes”
Open-sourcing Supabase ended up surprising us in many ways. Many people imagine that maintaining your business in public might be burdensome - but the opposite is true. There are many unexpected upsides that have made building Supabase - the product and the company - easier.
While some of this advice comes from our lens as a Dev Tools or PaaS company, most of it will apply to any software company.

                    <span>Sounds like Jacob Kaplan-Moss isn’t the only hiring manager who’s keen on the reverse code review:
When hiring developers, there are many things we are looking for, but over the years I have found that raw coding ability is easily the most important quality to look for.   I can quickly train a person to have knowledge in some domain, but I’ve never seen raw coding ability come from anything other than personal commitment to extensive and deep practice.   Because of this, I have found that some methods work better than others to discover talent.
… instead of writing code, consider instead having the candidate read existing code and talk about what it does and how it works. This offers some powerful advantages:
The advantages in brief:
Reading probes the most fundamental skills
Reading code is way more efficient than writing.
Reading puts candidates at ease compared to writing code.
Click through for the details and how to put this in to practice.

                    <span>A tragic tale, but one worth sharing because we can all learn from their mistake:
Due to an unfortunate sequence of events, I accidentally made the project’s repository private for a moment. And GitHub cascade-deleted our community that took 10 years to build.
Whoops! This reminds me of the time I thought it’d be cute to set JSPartyFM’s Twitter birth date to the day our first episode shipped, which immediately resulted in the account being suspended for being too young.
Sounds like GitHub isn’t up for restoring their stars, so if you were following HTTPie before, you’ll want to head over there and give ’em a re-star.

To set the stage, this is Kelsey’s response to Gerhard asking what the biggest takeaway should be from their conversation.
The reason we find ourselves as practitioners (as an industry as a whole) constantly migrating between different platforms, journeys, and digital transformations…
We do this because I don’t think we ever understood the fundamentals.
The fundamentals are very clear. If you’re thinking about application delivery, for example, we know what the fundamentals are.
Ideally, we’re versioning the source code we write, and using tools that enable us to build and package applications in a reproducible way. 15 years ago …</span>

                    <span>Gergely Orosz did an excellent job detailing the ins &amp; outs of Atlassian’s epic outage:
Hundreds of companies have no access to JIRA, Confluence and OpsGenie. What can engineering teams learn from the poor handling of this outage?
The TL;DR on the cause of the outage is a script that was supposed to “mark for deletion” some records also had “permanently delete” functionality and was run against a wrong list of IDs, improperly deleting 400 of their customers. Oh, and their backup restore process is really good at doing all customers, but not a subset. Ruh roh!
Lots to learn here, and Gergely puts a fine point on the biggest takeaways. A must-read!

DNS is simple enough that you can grok it quickly, but still complex enough that Adam learned a ton along the way: reading RFCs, network sockets, Bitvec, and more.

In our last two posts (1,2) we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to SLSA and covered the basics and details of how they’d use SLSA for their organizations. Today we’ll close out the series by exploring how each organization pulls together the various solutions into a heterogeneous supply chain. 
As a reminder, Acme is trying to produce a container image that contains three artifacts:

The Squirrel package ‘foo’
The Oppy package ‘baz’
A custom executable, ‘bar’, written by Acme employees.
The process starts with ‘foo’ package authors triggering a build using GitHub Actions. This results in a new version of ‘foo’ (an artifact with hash ‘abc’) being pushed to the Squirrel repo along with its SLSA proven…</span>

                    <span>In this episode we talk about launching Dagger with all four founders: Andrea, Eric, Sam &amp; Solomon.
While you may remember Sam &amp; Solomon from episode 23, this time we assembled all four superheroes in this story and went deeper, covering nearly three years of refinements, the launch, as well as the world-class team &amp; community that is coming together to solve the next problem of shipping software. Container images and Kubernetes are great steps in the right direction, but now it’s time for the next leap into the future.
You can use Dagger to run your CI/CD pipelines locally, without needing to commit and push. You can also use Dagger as a Makefile alternative, which resonates with Gerhard, but go further and your perspective on documentation &amp; automation may start shifting.

                    <span>On our episode with Brian Kernighan, I asked him if there were ever a situation in which he would advise you start a new program in C today. His response:
I think probably unless you are in one of these resource-constrained environments, clearly, right upfront, that you’re going to be resource-constrained and the improvement of hardware isn’t gonna rescue you in the next couple of years, I would not start with C. I really wouldn’t. And then it depends what is your application.
As if on queue, StackOverflow blogger Marcin Pasinski has done a comparison between C and Go in the quintessential resource-constrained environment. Oddly enough, no mention of TinyGo in the piece, but otherwise a solid analysis.

                    <span>Posted by Tom  Hennen, software engineer, BCID &amp; GOSST 

In our last post we introduced a fictional example of Squirrel, Oppy, and Acme learning to use SLSA and covered the basics of what their implementations might look like. Today we’ll cover the details: where to store attestations and policies, what policies should check, and how to handle key distribution and trust.

Attestation storage
Attestations play a large role in SLSA and it’s essential that consumers of artifacts know where to find the attestations for those artifacts.

Co-located in repo

Attestations could be colocated in the repository that hosts the artifact. This is how Squirrel plans to store attestations for packages. They even want to add support to the Squirrel CLI (e.g. acorn get-attestations foo@1.2.3).

                    <span>Nils Norman Haukås:
I have been a big fan of the write libraries, not frameworks argument for a while now. Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.
I don’t disagree!
The challenge with principles &amp; patterns is they are more difficult to formalize (and communicate) than libraries &amp; frameworks because they’re by nature less specific and more meta (lowercase “m” ftw).
In other words, libraries &amp; frameworks are an end product. Principles &amp; patterns are means to an end. It’s easier to ship a product than to ship the means to it.
The latter is the realm of documentation, education, and conversation.

One of the great benefits of SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is its flexibility. As an open source framework designed to improve the integrity of software packages and infrastructure, it is as applicable to small open source projects as to enterprise organizations. But with this flexibility can come a bewildering array of options for beginners—much like salsa dancing, someone just starting out might be left on the dance floor wondering how and where to jump in.
Though it’s tempting to try to establish a single standard for how to use SLSA, it’s not possible: SLSA is not a line dance where everyone does the same moves, at the same time, to the same song. It’s a varied system with different styles, moves, and flourishe…</span>

                    <span>Dan Luu:
Wave is a $1.7B company with 70 engineers whose product is a CRUD app that adds and subtracts numbers. In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.
Despite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero how one might build out a simple monolith… Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith.
He goes on to describe boring choices they’ve made and  counter-balances that some by also describing why they’ve made some more complex choices such as GraphQL and Kubernetes. An excellent, nuanced piece.

When was the last time you completed a project? When was the last time you started a project? Have you every felt that you were trapped working on something that you don’t enjoy anymore? Size is something that I’m sure most developers with the drive to do side projects have felt. Recently I have been completing more projects with more success than ever before. This is my new process.
His 4-step process is so simple it might be brilliant.

We talk about Docker Swarm beginnings, some of the challenges that it faced, and what Andrea’s recommendation is for Tyler’s journey with Docker Swarm.
After dedicating four years of his professional career to Docker Swarm, Andrea is the best person that Gerhard knows to talk about this subject. And guess what, the same thing happened now as it did at KubeCon 2015: Sam pointed to Andrea. It will all make sense in the first five minutes. This one is going to be fun!

                    <span>There’s a lot going on in that picture. Let’s take a closer look at exactly what computers and gear they were using to do the 3D animation for this game.
Why? Because, Final Fantasy 7 is a true classic. When the game was first released in early 1997, for the Sony PlayStation, it took the RPG gaming world by storm. To this day, many consider it the greatest entry in the franchise.
I remember getting this game for Christmas and playing it nearly non-stop until school started again after the new year. Greatest entry in the franchise? Easily!

                    <span>Solid piece on literate programming by Richard Gall for The New Stack. My foremost exposure to the practice came from Jeremy Ashkenas’ CoffeeScript and Backbone.js docs. I always found it cool and useful to read, but couldn’t imagine myself writing code/docs that way. Which brings us to this bit at the end of the article:
“One of the things we learned is that it’s very expensive,” he said. “And so you spend time trying to figure out what sort of situations justify the expense. And one of them is where people are building relatively small, sophisticated kernels that are going to be shared widely.”
Seems like Jeremy’s use case drilled it. If you’re mostly writing application code, literate programming probably isn’t worth the headache, but for library/framework authors…

Many of the recent high-profile software attacks that have alarmed open-source users globally were consequences of supply chain integrity vulnerabilities: attackers gained control of a build server to use malicious source files, inject malicious artifacts into a compromised build platform, and bypass trusted builders to upload malicious artifacts. 
Each of these attacks could have been prevented if there were a way to detect that the delivered artifacts diverged from the expected origin of the software. But until now, generating verifiable information that described where, when, and how software artifacts were produced (information known as provenance) was difficult. This information allows users to trace artif…</span>

                    <span>DuckDuckGo and Bing are not true alternatives – they’re just worse versions of Google.
The next Google can’t just be an input box that spits out links. We need new thinking to create something much better than what came before.
In the last few years, different groups of people came to the same conclusion, and started working on the next generation of search engines.
For this new generation, privacy is necessary, and invasive ads are not an option. But that’s where the commonalities end. Beyond that, they’ve all taken the idea of a search engine in very different directions.
The post goes on to describe &amp; detail a whole new wave of search engines. I had no idea so many people were working on this problem. Exciting!

                    <span>Asahi Linux is a project and community with the goal of porting Linux to Apple Silicon Macs, starting with the 2020 M1 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro.
Our goal is not just to make Linux run on these machines but to polish it to the point where it can be used as a daily OS. Doing this requires a tremendous amount of work, as Apple Silicon is an entirely undocumented platform. In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open-source driver for it.
Asahi Linux is developed by a thriving community of free and open source software developers.
Yes, please!

At Google, we constantly invest in security research to raise the bar for our devices, keeping our users safe and building their trust in our products. In 2021, we published Google Nest security commitments, in which we committed to engage with the research community to examine our products and services and report vulnerabilities.
We are now looking to deepen this relationship and accelerate the path toward building more secure devices. Starting today, we will introduce a new vulnerability rewards structure for submissions impacting smart home (Google Nest) and wearables (Fitbit) devices through our Bug Hunters platform. 
Bonus!

                    <span>For now, [x]it! is merely a file format specification.
You don’t have to use a specific tool for .xit files, the basic operations like creating items or checking them off can be done in every text editor. Tools can make the experience more convenient, though, and provide support for common use cases.
The cool thing is anybody/everybody can now develop integrations for their favorite tools.

                    <span>The Squeaky team goes from dev straight to prod (same here), but many people advocate for (and use) staging or other “pre-live” environments instead.
While there are obvious benefits to deploying to different environments, at Squeaky we’ve decided to take a different approach. We only have two environments: our laptops, and production. Once we merge into the main branch, it will be immediately deployed to production.
Perhaps that sounds unusual, but so far it’s outweighed the benefits of pre-live environments, and we believe it’s helping us to ship faster, and lower the number of issues on production. So, I thought I’d write this post to share why we think it works, and why you should consider it too.

                    <span>Hot off the press from our friend Ben Johnson:
Postlite is a network proxy to allow access to remote SQLite databases over the Postgres wire protocol. This allows GUI tools to be used on remote SQLite databases which can make administration easier.
The proxy works by translating Postgres frontend wire messages into SQLite transactions and converting results back into Postgres response wire messages. Many Postgres clients also inspect the pg_catalog to determine system information so Postlite mirrors this catalog by using an attached in-memory database with virtual tables. The proxy also performs minor rewriting on these system queries to convert them to usable SQLite syntax.
It appears that Ben is taking code contributions this time around, but only for bug &amp; documentation fixes.

It started as all good projects do … with Rick Astley.
After seeing the project about how to Rickroll your friends with Grafana — in which a seemingly innocent hyperlink surprises users with the music video for Astley’s classic “Never Gonna Give You Up” rendered with Prometheus and Grafana — a question arose: Can Grafana run Doom?
Thankfully, this post breaks Betteridge’s law of headlines. The answer to the question is a resounding yes!

                    <span>So what?
Well, that is the single largest expense we have. If we want to optimize anything in our discipline we should look at this part first. We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out” time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.
In addition to the author’s suggested solution to this problem allow me to add: developer retention! Nobody has more to figure out in a system than the people who just joined the team. Cut down on that (via better compensation, workplace satisfaction, etc.) and you cut way down on that oh so expensive “figuring out” time.

                    <span>Fine-grained authorization in microservices is hard. Definitely not impossible, but hard. You would expect that a more standardized, all-around, full-proof solution is out there, but I am afraid there isn’t. It’s a complex matter and depending on what you are building, implementation varies.
You will probably start with a boolean admin flag in your User model and then you will replace it with a role field, as we all did. However, as things progress and the business model becomes more and more complex, so do the solutions that we need to implement in order to deal with that complexity.
But how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment? In the following post I hope to help you get there.

                    <span>Today we have a special treat. A conversation with Brian Kernighan! Brian’s been in the software game since the beginning of Unix. Yes, he was there at Bell Labs when it all began. And he is still at it today, writing books and teaching the next generation at Princeton.
This is an epic and wide ranging conversation. You’ll hear about the birth of Unix, Ken Thompson’s unique skillset, why Brian thinks C has stood the test of time, his thoughts on modern languages like Go and Rust, what’s changed in 50 years of software, what makes platforms like Unix and the web so powerful, his take as a professor on the trend of programmers skipping the university track, and so much more.
Seriously, this is a must-listen.

                    <span>Lars Wikman reacts to Gerhard’s excellent conversation with Kelsey Hightower on Ship It!
So he essentially said, I’m interpreting here, that when it comes to deploying software to servers the documented manual steps for deploying something need to be the canonical reference. Then whether you build bash scripts, Ansible playbooks, Makefiles, Dockerfiles, Terraform, Kubernetes or something else to encode that procedure into something repeatable and scalable that’s a separate step. Having documented the process required to set it up means that there is an answer to the question: How do I get this running? An answer that doesn’t require you to parse the .yml files or grok Ansible roles and groups.
Lars springs forward from there with many thoughts of his own on the matter.

                    <span>It’s not hard to find articles or pieces of research claiming that the sooner you find a bug, the cheaper it is to fix. But I’ve found there isn’t actually a whole lot of information out there on exactly how to prevent bugs in the early stages of a software development project. i.e. before code is written, while requirements/user stories are being written or just after the requirements/user stories have been written.
Here I would like to share exactly how I help prevent bugs on projects and how I help others come up with ideas on how to prevent bugs as well.

                    <span>There is a general belief that legacy systems, stale code, and archaic tooling are sleeping dogs – we avoid them fearing a collapse from interference or deprioritize them for seemingly more important projects. I think this strategy of intentional avoidance and/or deprioritization is perfect for disasters.
The challenge with systems that do not fail is that they have no fixes when they eventually fail. Thus, it is more urgent to fix these systems than is usually accepted.

                    <span>A short, cogent argument why hosting your own cloud services is worth the time/effort:
Consider this, you carefully curate your playlists on Spotify but every now and then you see a certain song missing from your playlist. Same goes for videos saved in your YouTube playlists or other music/video streaming services. Then there is also the case of OTT streaming platforms where the show you were going to watch over weekend has now disappeared.
The author points to r/selfhosted and this awesome self hosted list as good resources to get started.

                    <span>The tree UI is ubiquitous in software applications. There are many tree component libraries for React, but none were full-featured enough to stand on their own.
This library provides all the common features expected in a tree. You can select one or many nodes to drag and drop into new positions, open and close folders, render an inline form for renaming, efficiently show thousands of items, and provide your own node renderer to control the style.

                    <span>Where by “auditing” they mean change tracking, not security testing:
Auditing is particularly useful for historical analysis. To demonstrate, imagine you have a users table that tracks when a user is online. You might add a status column which can have one of two values: online and offline. How would you track how long a user is online for throughout an entire month? An auditing system would track every change with timestamps, and so you can measure the difference between each timestamp and sum them up for the entire month.
What really impresses me about the Supabase team is how much they’re leaning in to Postgres’ rich feature set to build high-quality-yet-low-level abstractions for their users. Paul Copplestone emphasized this when we had him on the show back in January.

                    <span>This week we’re bringing The Changelog to Go Time — we had an awesome conversation with Toby Padilla, Co-Founder at Charm where they’re building tools to make the command line glamorous. Toby and the team at Charm have gone “all in” on Go — all of Charm is written in Go. They moved to Go from other languages, saying “Go is the answer to building these type of tools.” And even on this episode Toby says “I love Rust, it’s really cool, it’s a super-exciting language, but I jumped ship. I wanna be more productive, I wanna use all the fun toys, and so I started doing Go.” Clearly this episode will be in good company here on Go Time.
We talk about the state of the art, the next big thing happening on the command line and in ssh-land. They have an array of open source tooling to build great apps …</span>

                    <span>Max Howell, creator of Homebrew, has gone back to his notes on brew2 to apply web3 concepts to help “distribute value to open source.” He’s calling this new brew tea.
Tools like Homebrew lie beneath all development tools, assisting developers to actually get development done. We know the graph of all open source, which means we’re uniquely placed to innovate in interesting and exciting ways. This is exactly what tea will do. We’re taking our knowledge of how to make development more efficient and throwing innovations nobody has ever really considered before.
With plans to move the package registry on-chain, Max lays out the numerous benefits due to “inherent benefits of blockchain technology”:
Packages will be immutable (no more left-pad incidents)
Packages will always be available (we’ll use decentralized storage)
Releases will be signed by the maintainers themselves (rather than a middleman you are told you can trust)
Tools can be built to fundamentally verify the integrity of your app’s open source constitution
Token can flow through the graph
Max says “token flowing is where things get really interesting,” and goes on to say “with our system people who care about the health of the open source ecosystem buy some token and stake it.”

                    <span>From Jon Maddox on The GitHub blog (from waaay back in the day):
At GitHub, we have normalized on a set of script names for all of our projects that individual contributors will be familiar with the second after they clone a project. We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.
Here’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:
script/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies
script/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time
script/update – updates a project to run at its current version
script/server – starts app
script/test – runs tests
script/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests
script/console – opens a console
Each of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.
Note: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.

Accessing the right healthcare can be challenging depending on where people live and whether local caregivers have specialized equipment or training for tasks like disease screening. To help, Google Health has expanded its research and applications to focus on improving the care clinicians provide and allow care to happen outside hospitals and doctor’s offices.
