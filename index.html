                <p>WebSockets has been one of the most requested features and protocol to add to curl and libcurl in the annual user survey. Repeatedly, over the last few years. WebSockets is not perfectly suitable to be done by libcurl since it&#8217;s not really an upload or download transfer protocol, but is more something like &#8220;a TCP &#8230; Continue reading You wanted WebSockets? &#8594;</p>

                <p>Wise words from Rach Smith:
What I’ve learnt through experience is that the number of languages I’ve learned or the specific frameworks I’ve gained experience with matters very little. What actually matters is my ability to up-skill quickly and effectively. My success so far has nothing to do with the fact I know React instead of Vue, or have experience with AWS and not Azure. What has contributed to my success is the willingness to learn new tools as the need arises.

                <p>I read about KDL (pronounced “cuddle”) over the weekend. Color me impressed!
Kat (and others) put a lot of thought into this.
KDL is a document language with xml-like semantics that looks like you’re invoking a bunch of CLI commands! It’s meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration language, much like JSON, YAML, or XML.
Check out the FAQ for all the common objections (like why not YAML or TOML or ETC) as well as a note about the XKCD comic you’re probably thinking about. Here’s hopi…</p>

                <p>Chris Coyier on some of the new(ish) CSS compilers (such as Assembler) and how they’re flipping the script:
The popular Tailwind framework supports it. It kind of flips the mental model of Tailwind on its head, to me. Rather than providing a huge pile of CSS utility classes to use — then “purging” what is unused — it only creates what it needs to begin with.

Of course, these are just the defaults — docs for Elixir’s esbuild clearly state that NPM is still supported and you can always pass --no-assets and do things 100% your way. But it’s easy to underestimate the power of defaults, especially those that cover area outside of target audience’s expertise — which is the case of Phoenix devs and JS bundlers.

For years now, the possibility of coding in the cloud seemed so close, yet so far away for a number of reasons. According to Cory, the raw ingredients to make coding in the cloud a reality have been there for years. The challenge has really been how the industry thinks, and we are now at a place where the skepticism in cloud based workflows is “non-existent.”

                <p>Ain was born out of the frustration of working with many API endpoints in GUI clients.
While pretty, I could’t use any shell-scripts or commands such as uuidgen as input to the endpoints without copy pasting from a terminal. And I had to copy-paste the resulting output back into the terminal to further slice and dice it.
I had become a human pipe and my ctrl+c, ctrl+v fingers were hurting. By using curl and/or httpie for the heavy lifting, Ain removes you from the piping of input and output. With Ain, you c…</p>

Harbormaster is for you.
You create a YAML config file with all the git repos you want it to include and it’ll watch them for changes (on a timer) and do the necessary cloning/pulling, service restarting, etc. that needs doing to make it all run. Simple. Neat!

                <p>From Niels Leenheer:
It is not difficult to find some incredibly shitty takes on Electron, and every time it boils down to: It’s slow. Downloads are huge, and it uses a lot of memory. Electron apps are just websites. Developers that are using Electron are taking the lazy or easy approach to cross-platform development. Native apps are just better in every single way.
And somehow, these arguments often come from Apple fans when they discover one of their apps isn’t “native” or when a macOS favourite is consid…</p>

Buggy routing (and breaking your browser’s Back button) has been the achilles heel of SPAs since forver. Hopefully better tooling like this URLPattern proposal will help developers better handle the need.

Apple said Thursday it will relax some App Store rules in order to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by U.S.-based developers over its store terms.
…Apple will let developers communicate with users about alternative payment methods outside of the App Store. It will also set up a $100 million fund for small developers and make some other changes to its practices, but it’s keeping its overall commission structure.
This settlement is not yet approved by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers.

We are truly living in an era of user-hostile software, and when I say “user-hostile” I mean it as “software that doesn’t really care about the needs of the user but rather about the needs of the developer.” And this is not a problem that is bound to a specific operating system (or version thereof) or class or computers. It’s literally cross-platform, and it follows customers from home, to office, to their commute.

…think of this as an argparse equivalent for Bash. You provide a YAML file listing commands, subcommands, arguments, and flags, and it automatically generates a Bash script that can parse and validate them, provide help messages, and run your code for each command.
It also lets you keep the actual code for each command and subcommand in separate files, which are merged together into one distributable Bash script at generation time. It’s basically a tem…</p>

I don’t think I noticed I was burnt out until early February 2021, almost six months later. Honestly, realizing it was kind of a relief. I hadn’t noticed how bad it had gotten. A few weeks later, I quit my job. And then a new, different kind of struggle started. Not knowing what to do with myself, or how to recover.
So why did I burn out? I don’t know. It’s not a single thing - like a specific work stressor - that caused my burnout. It wa…</p>
