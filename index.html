Have you ever seen huge exception-handling blocks? Here is an example. Let&#x27;s assume we are calling bakePizza() to bake a pizza, and it can be overbaked, throwing a PizzaOverbakedException.




class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};


void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};


try {
  // 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
  ...
  bakePizza();
  // Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.
  ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new IllegalStateException(); // Root cause ignored while throwing new exception.
}



Here are the problems with the above code:

Obscuring the logic. The method bakePizza(), is obscured by the additional lines of code of preparation and delivery, so unintended exceptions from preparation and delivery may be caught.
Catching the general exception. catch (Exception e) will catch everything, despite that we might only want to handle PizzaOverbakedException here.
Rethrowing a general exception, with the original exception ignored. This means that the root cause is lost - we don&#x27;t know what exactly goes wrong with pizza baking while debugging.

Here is a better alternative, rewritten to avoid the problems above.



class PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};

void bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};

// 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.
...
try {
  bakePizza();
} catch (PizzaOverbakedException e) {  // Other exceptions won’t be caught.
  // Rethrow a more meaningful exception; so that we know pizza is overbaked.
  throw new IllegalStateException(“You burned the pizza!”, e);  
}
// Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.
...</span>

                    <span>In this enlightening episode, we delve deeper than the usual buzz surrounding AI’s perils, focusing instead on the tangible problems emerging from the use of machine learning algorithms across Europe. We explore “suspicion machines” — systems that assign scores to welfare program participants, estimating their likelihood of committing fraud. Join us as Justin and Gabriel share insights from their thorough investigation, which involved gaining access to one of these models and meticulously analyzing its behavior.

Systems such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Play rely on text classification models to identify harmful content including phishing attacks, inappropriate comments, and scams. These types of texts are harder for machine learning models to classify because bad actors rely on adversarial text manipulations to actively attempt to evade the classifiers. For example, they will use homoglyphs, invisible characters, and keyword stuffing to bypass defenses. 





To help make text classifiers more robust and efficient, we’ve developed a novel, multilingual text vectorizer called RETVec (Resilient &amp; Efficient Text Vectorizer) that helps models achieve state-of-the-art classification performance and drasticall…</span>

The book Clean Code discusses a camping rule that is good to keep in the back of your mind when writing code:



Leave the campground cleaner than you found it



So how does that fit into software development? The thinking is this: When you make changes to code that can potentially be improved, try to make it just a little bit better.
This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you have to go out of your way to do huge refactorings. Changing something small can go a long way:

                    <span>This week on we’re joined by Emil Sjölander from Figma — talking about bringing Dev Mode to Figma. Dev Mode is their new workspace in Figma that’s designed to bring developers and design to the same tool.
The question they’re trying to answer is “How do you create a home for developers in a design tool?” We go way back to Emil’s startup that was acquired by Figma called Visly, how we iterated to here from 20 years ago (think PSD &gt; HTML days), what they did to build Dev Mode, what they’re doing around codegen, the popularity of design systems, and what it takes to go from zero to Dev Mode.

Nearly half of third-parties fail to meet two or more of the Minimum Viable Secure Product controls. Why is this a problem? Because &quot;98% of organizations have a relationship with at least one third-party that has experienced a breach in the last 2 years.&quot;
In this post, we&#x27;re excited to share the latest improvements to the Minimum Viable Secure Product (MVSP) controls.

                    <span>Event-driven systems may not be the go-to solution for everyone because of the challenges they can add. While the system reacting to events published in other parts of the system seem elegant, some of the complexities they bring can be challenging.  However, they do offer durability, autonomy &amp; flexibility.
In this episode, we’ll define event-driven architecture, discuss the problems it solves, challenges it poses &amp; potential solutions.

                    <span>According to Solana Larsen: “Too often, it feels like we have lost control of the internet to the interests of Big Tech, Big Data — and now Big AI.” In the latest season of Mozilla’s IRL podcast (edited by Solana), a number of stories are featured to highlight the trailblazers who are reclaiming power over AI to put people first. We discuss some of those stories along with the issues that they surface.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Cory Doctorow (this episode contains explicit language) about how we can get back to that “new good internet.” Cory’s new book The Internet Con offers a lens to this conversation about disenshittifying the internet through anti-trust laws, limits on corporate tweaking, regulating unconstrained capitalism, and all the ways enshittification is enabled. Cory also shares his experience recording his own audio book under the direction of Gabrielle de Cuir at Skyboat Media, and what’s to come from his next Science Fiction book The Lost Cause.

Two days later, a policy paper was issued by the U.K. government entitled The Bletchley Declaration by Countries Attending the AI Safety Summit, 1-2 November 2023.  It was signed by 29 countries, including the United States and China, the global leaders in AI research.
In this Fully Connected episode, Daniel and Chris parse the details and highlight key takeaways from these documents, especially the extensive and detailed executive order, which has the force of law in the United States.

We are now happy to share the growing adoption in the ecosystem. MTE is now available on some OEM devices (as noted in a recent blog post by Project Zero) with Android 14 as a developer option, enabling developers to use MTE to discover memory safety issues in their application easily. 
The biggest contributor to security vulnerabilities are memory safety related defects and Google has invested in a set of technologies to help mitigate memory safety risks. These include but are not limited to:
