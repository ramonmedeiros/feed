                    <span>In our ops &amp; infra world, we learn to optimise for redundancy, for mean time to recovery and for graceful degradation. We instinctively recognise single points of failure, and try to mitigate the risks associated with them.
For some years now, Daniel Vassallo has been doing the same, but in the context of life &amp; work. Daniel talks about the role of randomness, about learning from small wins &amp; about optimising for a lifestyle that matches your true preferences,. Apparently, ideas too should be treated like cattle, not pets.

Biilmann described it as a ‚Äúchange away from monolithic solutions,‚Äù citing a couple of examples: Adobe Experience Manager ‚Äúas the DXP [digital experience platform] system for all your web productions‚Äù and Drupal ‚Äúas the core engine that both powers the backend and the frontend of your site, the business logic and the UI layer, and so on.‚Äù He argues that these types of ‚Äúmonolithic‚Äù solutions can ‚Äústart to feel very legacy and very dated.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not sure if ‚Äúcomposable architectures‚Äù will stick, but they sure did a good job of making ‚Äújamstack‚Äù a thing, so time will tell on that.

                    <span>Greg Schier from Railway:
The theory goes that if you ship code on Friday you‚Äôll inevitably be working Saturday to fix what you broke. This makes logical sense; software is messy and mistakes are unavoidable.
But no, shipping code on Friday isn‚Äôt bad. At least, it doesn‚Äôt have to be.
The key to their success is confidence, which comes from having a solid deployment pipeline and shipping through it often. Gerhard Lazu hit that nail on the head in this short clip as well.

                    <span>Posted by Oliver Chang, OSS-Fuzz team 
Since launching in 2016, Google&#x27;s free OSS-Fuzz code testing service has helped get over 8800 vulnerabilities and 28,000 bugs fixed across 850 projects. Today, we‚Äôre happy to announce an expansion of our OSS-Fuzz Rewards Program, plus new features in OSS-Fuzz and our involvement in supporting academic fuzzing research. 
Refreshed OSS-Fuzz rewards 
  
The OSS-Fuzz project&#x27;s purpose is to support the open source community in adopting fuzz testing, or fuzzing ‚Äî an automated code testing technique for uncovering bugs in software. In addition to the OSS-Fuzz service, which provides a free platform for continuous fuzzing to critical open source projects, we established an OSS-Fuzz Reward Program in 2017 as part of our wider Patch Rewards Program.

                    <span>Bryan Braun reflects on years of pairing:
I‚Äôve pair-programmed in a lot of different situations. I‚Äôve been the junior developer who needed to be unblocked. I‚Äôve been the new team member, being onboarded to a new codebase. I‚Äôve paired with peers for knowledge-sharing and productivity. And I‚Äôve been the senior dev.
He goes on to say that it‚Äôs easy to put a pairing session on rails to avoid embarrassment, but:
When I think back, my favorite pair-programming sessions were the one where things went wrong. These were the moments that taught me what being a programmer is all about. What do you do when you don‚Äôt know what to do? How do you break down a new problem? What tools do you reach for? When do you abandon your current approach? These are things you can‚Äôt learn from a blog post.

                    <span>What‚Äôs the current reality and practical implications of using 3D environments for simulation and synthetic data creation? In this episode, we cut right through the hype of the Metaverse, Multiverse, Omniverse, and all the ‚Äúverses‚Äù to understand how 3D assets and tooling are actually helping AI developers develop industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, and more. Beau Perschall is at the center of these innovations in his work with NVIDIA, and there is no one better to help us explore the topic!

                    <span>Robin Linacre:
SQL should be the first option considered for new data engineering work. It‚Äôs robust, fast, future-proof and testable. With a bit of care, it‚Äôs clear and readable. A new SQL engine - DuckDB - makes SQL competitive with other high performance dataframe libraries, making SQL a good candidate for data of all sizes.
You can make a similar argument for SQL that Gary Bernhardt made for Vim. Here‚Äôs Gary on Vim, run your own s/Vim/SQL/g filter on this as you read it:
‚Ä¶just for me, 15 years; at the beginning of that time, TextMate was just becoming popular. Then it was Sublime Text was cool. Then Atom was cool. Then VS Code was cool. A lot of people switched between two of those, three of those, maybe all four of those, and that whole time I was just getting better and better and better at Vim‚Ä¶ And you multiply that out by the length of a career, you use Vim for 40 years - you‚Äôre gonna be so good at it by the end, and it‚Äôs still gonna be totally relevant, I think.

When you work with a format as complex as yaml, it is difficult to be aware of all the features and subtle behaviors it has. There is an entire website dedicated to picking one of the 63 different multi-line string syntaxes. This means that it can be very difficult for a human to predict how a particular document will parse. Let‚Äôs look an example to highlight this‚Ä¶

Wouldn‚Äôt it be neat to have aggregated data (for a website, daily email, push alert, etc) of kids events in our surrounding area so we know about them right away?

                    <span>Chip Huyen:
When we actively hire, our startup gets 150 - 200 applications each month. I read every single one of them. Sometimes, I‚Äôd talk to a candidate and see that what we perceived as their strongest aspects actually weren‚Äôt included in their resume. Occasionally, a candidate would tell me that they didn‚Äôt expect their resume to still be screened by humans ‚Äì had they known, they would have written their resume differently.
The resume evaluation process is pretty much a black box for most candidates. And it is so because few hiring managers have publicly discussed this. I thought I should start the conversation.
Chip‚Äôs team mostly hires for infra and ML roles, so some of the advice here will be catered towards those positions. Still, if you‚Äôre on the job market you‚Äôd be well-served by spending 15-20 minutes reading this post and tweaking your resume where applicable.

ZITADEL has a really interesting workload that is both CPU intensive and latency sensitive. On top of this, their users are global, and traffic is bursty. Florian talks about how they evaluated AWS, GCP &amp; Azure before they settled on the platform that met their requirements.

                    <span>I‚Äôm currently working at a top tier investment bank as a software engineer. I‚Äôm an insignificant cog in a machine that skims the cream from the milk. I‚Äôm earning the most money I‚Äôve ever made and yet I‚Äôm the least fulfilled I‚Äôve ever been.
Right now in the UK and across the world, things are uncertain. Companies are laying workers off, there‚Äôs a cost of living and energy crisis. I‚Äôm excruciatingly lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to develop the skillset I‚Äôve got. In times like these every signal is telling me to stay on the path I‚Äôm on, enjoying the comfort and safety of a high paying job.
I‚Äôm not going to listen. I‚Äôm quitting and I‚Äôm leaving this place. I‚Äôll see you in the mountains.
After this post blew up, Se√°n wrote a follow-up on what quitting the rat race means to him.

                    <span>Yup, that Neon. Congrats to Nikita and team for this big win.
Databases and web apps go together like peanut butter and jelly. In a word, they‚Äôre inseparable. And despite all the amazing innovations in NoSQL data stores, often a good old relational database is the most reliable tool for the job.
We want to make it completely seamless to develop applications that need databases on Replit. Starting today, you can create and instantly begin to use PostgreSQL databases from within the Replit workspace.
The fine print.
Under the hood, this product is powered by our friends at Neon who have created a lightning-fast serverless database. The database will go to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity. Most clients should handle the reconnection seamlessly.

It includes everything you need to build an API and deploy it to AWS Lambda. Jets leverages the power of Ruby to make serverless joyful for everyone.
I‚Äôm not (yet) big on serverless things, but if I were, I‚Äôd love to run some Ruby code there.

                    <span>Lars is big on Elixir. Think apps that scale really well, tend to be monolithic, and have one of the most mature deployment models: self-contained releases &amp; built-in hot code reloading. In episode 7, Gerhard talked to Lars about ‚ÄúWhy Kubernetes‚Äù. There is a follow-up YouTube stream that showed how to automate deploys for an Elixir app using K3s &amp; ArgoCD.
More than a year later, how does Lars think about running applications in production? What does simple &amp; straightforward mean to him? Gerhard‚Äôs favourite: what is ‚Äúhuman scale deployments‚Äù?

The best code is no code, or code you don‚Äôt have to maintain
Every system eventually sucks, get over it

                    <span>This project is from the SQLite team themselves. Their reasoning for it:
SQLite is sometimes used as the core of a client/server database system. While it works reliably well in such cases, the database backend module that it uses to store b-tree structures in its database file was not designed with this case in mind and can be improved upon in several ways. The HC-tree (hctree) project is an attempt to develop a new database backend that improves upon regular SQLite as follows‚Ä¶
It improves concurrency, adds support for replication &amp; removes database size limitations.

Datasette is an open source tool that takes an SQLite database and gives you an out-of-the-box, web-based UI built specifically for exploring data. Need an example? Here‚Äôs a database of all of Motley Fool‚Äôs earning transcripts that I used to look for talk of their California campaign activity. And here‚Äôs a bunch of other examples of Datasette from the official site.
And the thing is: I love Datasette. It recently turned 5 years old and I wanted to write down the thing that makes it an absolutely delightful data hammer.

                    <span>Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.
This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.
LangChain is designed to help with prompts, chains (sequences of calls), data augmented generation, agents, memory &amp; evaluation tasks.

                    <span>Tyler Cipriani read ‚Äú‚ÄòDid you miss my comments or what?‚Äô Understanding Toxicity in Open Source Discussions,‚Äù and learned about entitlement:
The term is new (to me), but the paper renders a familiar scene, ‚ÄúThe author is usually visibly upset about not being able to use the tool, often complaining about wasted time.‚Äù
The situation is all-too-common and exhausting. And when it happens over-and-over, maintainers give up.
It made me wonder: why have I never seen ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù in a code of conduct?
Good question‚Ä¶

                    <span>Alex Ewerl√∂f and his team implemented ‚ÄúTech Debt Friday‚Äù
Engineers looked forward to the Tech Debt Friday. The team would happily remind management that this day cannot (under any circumstances) be planned for regular feature/bugfix work. Although we fixed some bugs along the way, this was primarily an investment to make future feature development cheaper while improving the maintainability and reliability.
Initially it was hard to defend spending 10% of the team bandwidth on tech debt, but over time the payback was huge
He goes on to list eight things that happened as result of this policy. Good stuff.

This strikes me as smart for Medium and a big vote of confidence for Mastodon and the entire concept of federated social networking. With Tumblr support (allegedly) coming as well, what‚Äôs next? Reddit?!

                    <span>If you are the technical co-founder or early engineering lead at a startup, and you want to talk about your microservices, hand-rolled CI/CD, in-house monitoring stack, or any other unique part of your stack, I will say: Cool. Let‚Äôs riff. Take me deep, I‚Äôm ready.
But there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm likely to tell you in return, something I‚Äôll probably insist you‚Äôre overlooking and need to internalize as soon as possible: Your technology stack is not the product.
It‚Äôs easy to get too focused on our tech and tools. Sometimes we think it‚Äôs our competitive advantage, other times it‚Äôs merely personal fascination and intellectual stimulation. This post is a good reminder:
A mindset of technology being the means, not the end, is uncomfortable. But it will help you stay focused on what matters most (the product and your customers), avoid wasteful misadventures, and maximize the company‚Äôs chance of success.

I‚Äôve also classified these patterns for easy accessing, and based on the pattern entropy I provide guesstimates about the effort for a brute force attack.

                    <span>Scott Antipa:
I‚Äôm working on a flowchart editor that runs in the browser, and I wanted a way for people to use it without having to sign in, or store any data on our server. I wanted to give them control over their data and to be able to store it locally to open and edit later. And also easily share it with other people. It‚Äôs easy to do this by supporting file upload/download, but I wanted something simpler, like the ability to share by sending a url. I also didn‚Äôt want to store anything on the backend (at least for the free tier).
What he decided on was to base64 encode the entire application state and store it in the fragment section of the URL. I love all the upsides of this approach and it‚Äôs pretty trivial to accomplish. Here‚Äôs the pseudocode that Scott provides in his post:
const stateString &#x3D; JSON.stringify(appState); // appState is a json object
const compressed &#x3D; compress(stateString);
const encoded &#x3D; Base64.encode(compressed);
// Push that &#x60;encoded&#x60; string to the url
// ... Later, on page load or on undo/redo we read the url and
// do the following
const decoded &#x3D; Base64.decode(encoded); // same encoded as above, but read from url
const uncompressed &#x3D; uncompress(decoded);
const newState &#x3D; JSON.parse(uncompressed);
// Now load your application with the newState

                    <span>Cedric Chin, writing about the famous adage that says ‚Äúwhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.‚Äù
At some level, this is self-evident. Goodhart‚Äôs Law is about as pithy and about as practicable as ‚Äúthe only certainty in life is death and taxes‚Äù and ‚Äúhell is other people.‚Äù It is descriptive; it tells you of the existence of a phenomenon, but it doesn‚Äôt tell you what to do about it or how to solve it.
There are more useful formulations of the law that help solve it. Some organizations use this narrower, more actionable form:
When people are pressured to meet a target value there are three ways they can proceed:
They can work to improve the system
They can distort the system
Or they can distort the data
With that framing in hand, Cedric goes on to describe how you can solve for these three ways and design incentive/measurement systems that work.

                    <span>Posted by Dana Jansens (she/her), Chrome Security Team  
We are pleased to announce that moving forward, the Chromium project is going to support the use of third-party Rust libraries from C++ in Chromium. To do so, we are now actively pursuing adding a production Rust toolchain to our build system. This will enable us to include Rust code in the Chrome binary within the next year. We‚Äôre starting slow and setting clear expectations on what libraries we will consider once we‚Äôre ready. 
In this blog post, we will discuss how we arrived at the decision to support third-party Rust libraries at this time, and not broader usage of Rust in Chromium. 
Why We Chose to Bring Rust into Chromium
Our goal in bringing Rust into Chromium is to provide a simpler (no IPC) and safer (less complex C++ overal‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Marcos Nils has been into platform engineering for the best part of the last decade. He helped architect &amp; build developer platforms using VMs &amp; OpenStack, containers with Docker, and even Kubernetes. He did this at startups with 10 people, as well as large, publicly traded companies with 1000+ software engineers.
Today we talk with Marcos about the hard parts of platform engineering.

                    <span>A long-standing debate between me and a peer at work has been how we should name services. His position was always that services should be named something descriptive, so that you can infer from the name what it does. My position is that the name should definitely not be descriptive, but should be something cute and wholly disconnected from the purpose. And I think this applies more broadly to projects and companies, too.
Nicholas‚Äô reason for cute names winning comes down to the inevitably of change in a service/project‚Äôs function and the difficulty in renaming things. I hadn‚Äôt thought of that argument, but I already agreed with the premise.
We also apply this thinking to podcast episode names, which can be a mixed bag because descriptive titles certainly help when it comes to discovery. As Adam and I discussed on our recent State of the ‚Äúlog‚Äù episode, if you see use a descriptive title, it‚Äôs most likely because we couldn‚Äôt think of a good cute/interesting one.
But that‚Äôs just our opinion about episode naming. What do you prefer?

                    <span>Thomas Depierre, writing about the concept of the Software Supply Chain in the context of open source development:
We are not suppliers. All the people writing and maintaining these projects, we are not suppliers. We do not have a business relationship with all these organisations. We are volunteers, writing code and putting it online under these Licences. And yes, we put it online for people to use them. But we do not get anything from it.
He goes on to discuss how, importantly, licenses such as the MIT point this out (in all caps):
If you use this, I owe you nothing. At all. We have no relationship. I put this up online on the condition that if you use it, all the risks are on you‚Ä¶ So all your Software Supply Chain ideas? You are not buying from a supplier, you are a raccoon digging through dumpsters for free code. So I would advise you to put these rules in the same dumpster. And remember. I am not a supplier.
That raccoon line reminds me of a now-ancient meme you might still enjoy‚Ä¶

                    <span>This escalated quickly. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm a daily user of ChatGPT. Just yesterday, I asked ‚ÄúWhat options does Linux offer for fast RAID 0 software RAID?‚Äù and I had an entire conversation that settled on Btrfs as a good option and I learned how to create and configure the array, mount it, and most importantly scrub it for errors. I‚Äôll still use ZFS, of course. But, I‚Äôve never had that experience using Google (nor can you).
‚Ä¶according to a report by Semafor, Microsoft Corp is discussing the possibility of acquiring OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT. The tech-industry giant is ready to pay upwards of $10 billion for the acquisition.
Clearly, Microsoft sees the bigger picture here for Bing, Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, and more. This also speaks to the conversation we had with Swyx about AI‚Äôs future being tied to capitalism and eventually being controlled by the FAANGs.

                    <span>Tim McNamara makes an important distinction that is often lost on us:
Agile doesn‚Äôt make your team magically speed up its ability to close tickets. Instead, it speeds up the team‚Äôs decision-making process. It‚Äôs about orientation, not velocity. An agile workflow is one where you are able to quickly adjust direction based on short feedback cycles.
Mat, Natalie &amp; I touched on this when they dragged me on to Go Time last summer to share some thoughts on velocity. Worth a (re)listen if you‚Äôre in to such things.

                    <span>Shahed Nasser shares how she and the technical writing team at Medusa went about improving their docs:
The most essential change that helped us implement all improvements is how we manage the documentation. In most software companies, documentation has less of a priority compared to the software, and it is handled as an afterthought.
At Medusa, we early on came to realize that documentation is what can actually drive further adoption of Medusa.
There‚Äôs a lot to learn from their process that you can apply to your own, but I think the biggest winner Shahed shares is the mindset change of thinking about documentation itself as a product, not as something that augments or attaches to the product.

                    <span>Sometimes all a project needs is the ability to read/write small amounts of JSON data and have it saved in some persistent storage. Imagine a simple data-model which receives infrequent updates and could be represented as JSON object. It doesn‚Äôt demand a full-blown database, but it would be neat to have a way to interact with this data and have it persist across sessions.
This is where gist-database comes in handy, by leveraging the power of the gist api you can easily create a key/value data-store for your project.
This is a perfect solution for low write / high read scenarios when serving static site content with Next.js and using Incremental Static Regeneration to keep your cached content fresh.

At this point, we are confident that there are no unauthorized actors active in our systems; however, out of an abundance of caution, we want to ensure that all customers take certain preventative measures to protect your data as well.
