Toby and the team at Charm have gone “all in” on Go — all of Charm is written in Go. They moved to Go from other languages, saying “Go is the answer to building these type of tools.” And even on this episode Toby says “I love Rust, it’s really cool, it’s a super-exciting language, but I jumped ship. I wanna be more productive, I wanna use all the fun toys, and so I started doing Go.” Clearly this episode will be in good company here on Go Time.
We talk about the state of the art, the next big thing happening on the command line and in ssh-land. They have an array of open source tooling to build great apps …</span>

                    <span>Max Howell, creator of Homebrew, has gone back to his notes on brew2 to apply web3 concepts to help “distribute value to open source.” He’s calling this new brew tea.
Tools like Homebrew lie beneath all development tools, assisting developers to actually get development done. We know the graph of all open source, which means we’re uniquely placed to innovate in interesting and exciting ways. This is exactly what tea will do. We’re taking our knowledge of how to make development more efficient and throwing innovations nobody has ever really considered before.
With plans to move the package registry on-chain, Max lays out the numerous benefits due to “inherent benefits of blockchain technology”:
Packages will be immutable (no more left-pad incidents)
Packages will always be available (we’ll use decentralized storage)
Releases will be signed by the maintainers themselves (rather than a middleman you are told you can trust)
Tools can be built to fundamentally verify the integrity of your app’s open source constitution
Token can flow through the graph
Max says “token flowing is where things get really interesting,” and goes on to say “with our system people who care about the health of the open source ecosystem buy some token and stake it.”

                    <span>From Jon Maddox on The GitHub blog (from waaay back in the day):
At GitHub, we have normalized on a set of script names for all of our projects that individual contributors will be familiar with the second after they clone a project. We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.
Here’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:
script/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies
script/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time
script/update – updates a project to run at its current version
script/server – starts app
script/test – runs tests
script/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests
script/console – opens a console
Each of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.
Note: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.

                    <span>ZFS has become very portable in recent years of its development, supporting six (6) operating systems: FreeBSD, Illumos, Linux, MacOS, NetBSD, and Windows. But what if you wanted to create a ZPool compatible with all of them? Which options and ZFS features should you choose?

                    <span>Over the years, teams across Google have focused on how technology — specifically artificial intelligence and hardware innovations — can improve access to high-quality, equitable healthcare across the globe.
Accessing the right healthcare can be challenging depending on where people live and whether local caregivers have specialized equipment or training for tasks like disease screening. To help, Google Health has expanded its research and applications to focus on improving the care clinicians provide and allow care to happen outside hospitals and doctor’s offices.
Today, at our Google Health event The Check Up, we’re sharing new areas of AI-related research and development and how we’re providing clinicians with easy-to-use tools to help them better care for patients. Here’s a look at som…</span>

Do you remember the last time that you used an app, whether it was in the browser or on your mobile, and everything just worked? What about that intuitive feel, snappiness and you achieving the task that you intended to without feeling that you are fighting tech? Experiences like those take a lot of effort across multiple disciplines. They are designed, built and maintained over long periods of time. It all starts with people like Pia that really care about quality. It’s so much more than just automated testing…

                    <span>The term “foundation” model has been around since about the middle of last year when a research group at Stanford published the comprehensive report On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models. The naming of these models created some strong reactions, both good and bad. In this episode, Chris and Daniel dive into the ideas behind the report.

!important was added for one reason only: laws in the US that require certain text to be in a given font-size. !important stops the cascade from changing it.
Anything else is probably misuse, and a sign you may not understand the cascade properly.

                    <span>The New Stack overviews a recently published 2017 (3-hours long) interview with the living legend, who rarely speaks publicly about herself:
Hamilton remembered being the only woman in her college physics class — “And at the time, I think the professor thought women should not be taking physics because he  … well, you have to know the times.”
She added, “That was the only time somebody in college questioned that that might not be something I would be able to make use of.”
But Hamilton remained undeterred: “I just said, ‘Because I want to take it,’ you know.”

But just like that time you whacked a zombie over the head with a shovel only to discover it was really your friend Jimmy with a hangover, this would be a grave mistake. And I use the term ‘grave’ advisedly, because having sent Jimmy to an early grave, this would increase the likelihood of him becoming a zombie in the not too distant future.

This opens up possibilities to not only reverse engineer web app private APIs in a deeper way, but also to do the same kind of research against desktop apps for purposes such as data scraping, automation, vulnerability research and privacy analysis.

One key decision, made for speed above all else, is to capture as much of my thinking and work in plaintext as I can. Thus the name: Plaintext Productivity
This article speaks my language, but does so to a corner of the software world that I don’t visit too often: Windows
Windows is a critical element in this system because it is hard to find good productivity software that runs on Windows, especially if you want to run it outside of a web browser. Windows, in my opinion, is far behind Mac OS X, iOS, and Android, in having thoughtfully designed and efficient software—both in general, and in particular for writing, organization, and task management

                    <span>A falsehood is an idea that you initially believe was true, but in-reality it is proven to be false.
E.g. of an idea: valid email address exactly has one @ character. So, you will use this rule to implement your email-field validation logic. Right? Wrong! The reality is: emails can have multiple @ chars. Therefore your implementation should allow this. The initial idea is a falsehood you believed in.
I love this list with my whole heart. We need to do a show on this…

                    <span>One of the most interesting parts of working at Google is learning what other people do here — it’s not uncommon to come across a job title you’ve never heard of. For example: ProFair Program Manager, or ProFair Analyst.
These roles are part of our Responsible Innovation team, which focuses on making sure our tech supports Google’s AI Principles. One way the team does this is by conducting proactive algorithmic product fairness — or ProFair — testing. This means bringing social and cultural perspectives to the testing process, to assess how an AI or ML application, dataset or technique might avoid reinforcing unfair bias. Three women who work on ProFair testing are Anne Peckham, N’Mah Y. and Cherish M. and today we’re asking them: What’s your job?

                    <span>John Ruble:
On any moderately-sized Node.js project you’ve likely already outgrown the package.json “scripts” section. But because the growth was gradual, with no single acute pain point, you might not have noticed. There’s a better way.
I’ve never been able to get into Makefiles, but many people I respect love them. For me the syntax is too arcane, but I recognize the power. If the “scripts” section of your package.json is getting unwieldy, it might be time for a make over. (yes I went there)

                    <span>I’ve avoided using Docker Desktop on my Mac like you avoid those 16-seeds in your March Madness bracket. Why? Because it’s dog slow. But not anymore?
The 4.6 release of Docker Desktop for Mac contains a number of changes that drastically improve file sharing performance for macOS users. Firstly, developers now have the option of using a new experimental file sharing implementation called virtiofs (the current default is gRPC-FUSE). Secondly, improvements have been made to the way that files are synced between the macOS host and Docker VM. During testing with our amazing macOS community of users, we have observed that these changes have reduced the time taken to complete filesystem operations by up to 98%.
virtiofs is an experimental feature, so you need to enable it to realize these gains.

                    <span>This piece by Aria Beingessner is incredibly relevant to our shipping-this-week episode with Brian Kernighen:
My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.
C is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.
And just in case these pull quotes leave you with the impression that Aria is happy about the situation… yeah, nope.

Why now?
The amount of value this team has given to the web world over the years is immeasurable.

In their moment, minicomputers were used in a variety of applications. They served as communications controllers, instrument controllers, large system pre-processors, desk calculators, and real-time data acquisition handlers. But they also laid the foundation for significant hardware architecture advances and contributed greatly to modern operating systems, programming languages, and interactive computing as we know them today.
We were just discussing this machine on our upcoming episode with Brian Kernighan.

                    <span>HUBFS is a file system for GitHub and Git. Git repositories and their contents are represented as regular directories and files and are accessible by any application, without the application having any knowledge that it is really accessing a remote Git repository. The repositories are writable and allow editing files and running build operations.
So if you hubfs mnt (on macOS/Linux), it will set up a file hierarchy inside /mnt that follows this pattern: / owner / repository / ref / path. Cool idea! It is affected by GitHub’s API rate limiting and I’m not sure if/how it syncs (commits) back to the remote repos…

Use conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Don’t use too many, and use the same status codes for the same outcomes across the API.
Smile Egbai had a solid rant about this on Go Time recently.

                    <span>Julia Evans lays out her process for taking API responses in her browser’s dev tools and using them in her own programs/scripts:
look in developer tools for a promising JSON response
copy as cURL
remove irrelevant headers
translate it into Python
Some of you might be wondering – can you always do this?
The answer is sort of yes – browsers aren’t magic! All the information browsers send to your backend is just HTTP requests. So if I copy all of the HTTP headers that my browser is sending, I think there’s literally no way for the backend to tell that the request isn’t sent by my browser and is actually being sent by a random Python program.

                    <span>This proposal is brand new (stage 0), but I hear that a lot of work has been put into it behind the scenes by a lot of people, so it has that going for it…
This proposal aims to enable developers to add type annotations to their JavaScript code, allowing those annotations to be checked by a type checker that is external to JavaScript. At runtime, a JavaScript engine ignores them, treating the types as comments.
The aim of this proposal is to enable developers to run programs written in TypeScript, Flow, and other static typing supersets of JavaScript without any need for transpilation, if they stick within a certain reasonably large subset of the language.
The implications of this change are pretty massive, if it were to ever ship. And you better believe we’re putting together a JS Party episode to discuss it with the people involved.

                    <span>Gary Marcus makes the case that deep learning has hit a wall:
Let me start by saying a few things that seem obvious,” Geoffrey Hinton, “Godfather” of deep learning, and one of the most celebrated scientists of our time, told a leading AI conference in Toronto in 2016. “If you work as a radiologist you’re like the coyote that’s already over the edge of the cliff but hasn’t looked down.” Deep learning is so well-suited to reading images from MRIs and CT scans, he reasoned, that people should “stop training radiologists now” and that it’s “just completely obvious within five years deep learning is going to do better.”
Fast forward to 2022, and not a single radiologist has been replaced.
But he doesn’t stop there. After laying out multiple examples of deep learning failures, he change tone:
For the first time in 40 years, I finally feel some optimism about AI.

                    <span>Posted by Adrian Taylor, Chrome Security Team
If you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like &#x27;exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild&#x27; have been appearing more often recently. In this post we&#x27;ll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We&#x27;ll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. 
How things work today 
While the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it&#x27;s because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it&#x27;s actually a good thing! I…</span>

                    <span>Jean Yang:
Should you move to serverless? Is GraphQL the answer to your API woes? Should you follow the latest DevOps playbook to increase your system reliability? In the world of tech tools, there’s a lot of buzz. But it doesn’t always reflect the daily reality of programmers.
As the founder of a developer tools startup, I’ve talked with hundreds, if not thousands, of software developers over the last few years in the course of routine user research. The common theme in these conversations, even bigger than the need for the product we were building, was an overarching need that is currently underserved: building for real developers, or what I like to call the 99% Developers.
Good stuff to be reminded of. That reminds me: You are not Google/Amazon/LinkedIn.

                    <span>Rich Burroughs:
When you hear the phrase “cloud native,” is Kubernetes the first thing that comes to your mind? It is for me, and I expect I’m not alone. Kubernetes is now the second-largest open source project after Linux, and it’s the big fish in the cloud native pond. But there are many other projects in the CNCF landscape and the broader cloud native community.
So, I thought I’d list some cloud native tools that can be very useful for teams that aren’t using Kubernetes or aren’t using it for every workload. Here are 7 of them that I like a lot.
If Rich’s name rings a bell, that’s because he was just on Ship It! last week. 😉

                    <span>Secure applications start with secure code. As organizations deploy code faster than ever, implementing continuous security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is critical to building secure products. As a long-time HackerOne Bounty customer, GitLab knows the importance of identifying and addressing bugs as early as possible in the SDLC. We wanted to hear what they had to say about leveraging the human intelligence of ethical hackers to broadly test their attack surface and increase their ability to resist potential threats.</span>

                    <span>It’s possible to pair well simply by avoiding pairing poorly.
I’ve never thought about it that way, but yeah, makes sense. What follows is a list of things not to do when pairing. Things for navigators, things for drivers, and things for both.
This is just one page from Tuple’s pair programming guide, which looks excellent all-around.

                    <span>Samuel Berthe:
This project have started as an experiment to discover generics implementation. It may look like Lodash in some aspects. I used to code with the awesome go-funk package, but it uses reflection and therefore is not typesafe.
As expected, benchmarks demonstrate that generics will be much faster than implementations based on reflect stdlib package. Benchmarks also shows similar performances to pure for loops.

                    <span>This week we have the pleasure of Rich Burroughs, Senior Developer Advocate at Loft Labs and host of the Kube Cuddle podcast.
We talk about multitenancy in Kubernetes and how to run Kubernetes in Kubernetes with vcluster. If you are using KiND, you will find this episode interesting, and maybe even helpful.
We also talk about the role that Kelsey Hightower played in Rich joining the CNCF ecosystem. The key take-away is that people make all the difference.
ADHD is something that Rich thinks about often. Gerhard was curious about the difference between ADHD and burnout, as well as this Twitter thread on re-reading sent emails.

                    <span>So Argc is a little Rust program that your bash scripts can use to make handling command-line parameters easy. You describe the options, parameters, and subcommands in comments like this:
# @describe A demo cli

# @cmd Upload a file
# @arg target!                      File to upload
upload() {
    echo &quot;cmd                       upload&quot;
    echo &quot;arg:  target              $argc_target&quot;
}

Then you trust Argc to parse that and do the heavy lifting:
eval &quot;$(argc -e $0 &quot;$@&quot;)&quot;

The only drawback (aside from potential parsing bugs) to this approach is your script now depends on having argc in the machine’s executable path. i.e. – it’s not portable.
What’d be even cooler, IMHO, would be to instead use argc as a pre-processor of sorts that spits out a pure-bash implementation from your input script. Regardless, a cool idea!

                    <span>Chris Ferdinandi:
For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!
I built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I’ve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.
Heck, even Chris’s disclaimer of ‘when SPAs make sense’ section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation. But I digress… read this post it’s a good one for sure.

                    <span>Writing high quality standards is a necessary first step to an interoperable web platform, but ensuring that browsers are consistent in their behavior requires an ongoing process. Browsers must work to ensure that they have a shared understanding of web standards, and that their implementation matches that understanding.
Interop 2022 is a cross-browser initiative to find and address the most important interoperability pain points on the web platform. The end result is a public metric that will assess progress toward fixing these interoperability issues.

                    <span>DNA is the language of life: our DNA forms a living record of things that went well for our ancestors, and things that didn’t. DNA tells our body (and every other organism) which proteins to produce; these proteins are tiny machines that carry out enormous tasks, from fighting off infection to helping you ace an upcoming exam in school.


But for about a third of all proteins that all organisms produce, we just don’t know what they do. It’s kind of like we’re in a factory where everything’s buzzing, and we’re surrounded by all these impressive tools, but we have only a vague idea of what’s going on. Understanding how these tools operate, and how we can use them, is where we think machine learning can make a big difference.

My written words are my most precious asset. They are also a history of my life. That’s why I only use plain text files. They are the most reliable, flexible, and long-lasting option. Here’s why.

A new storage engine for PostgreSQL, bringing a modern approach to database capacity, capabilities and performance to the world’s most-loved database platform.
OrioleDB consists of an extension, building on the innovative table access method framework and other standard Postgres extension interfaces. By extending and enhancing the current table access methods, OrioleDB opens the door to a future of more powerful storage models that are optimized for cloud and modern hardware architectures.

                    <span>This week we’re joined by the “mad scientist” himself, Feross Aboukhadijeh…and we’re talking about the launch of Socket — the next big thing in the fight to secure and protect the open source supply chain.
While working on the frontlines of open source, Feross and team have witnessed firsthand how supply chain attacks have swept across the software community and have damaged the trust in open source. Socket turns the problem of securing open source software on its head, and asks…“What if we assume all open source may be malicious?” So, they built a system that proactively detects indicators of compromised open source packages and brings awareness to teams in real-time. We cover the whys, the hows, and what’s next for this ambitious and very much needed project.

                    <span>I came across an interesting use case for edge compute the other day: cookie management at the edge. It probably won’t be super relevant to a ton of people, but it’s an interesting use case I wanted to share, nonetheless.

                    <span>Almond.CSS helps in two ways: it normalizes the CSS styles to provide similar experience cross-browser, and it spices things a little by adding custom styles (that can be personalized!)
Use the different HTML5 semantic tags on your website, include the library in your project, and let CSS and the browser work their magic. Just combine your HTML and Almond CSS (no JavaScript needed.)
Demo here. Looks like a great starter for simple side projects and the like.

                    <span>If you’ve accessed the MDN website today, you probably noticed that it looks quite different. We hope it’s a good different. Let us explain!
In mid-2021 we started to think about modernizing MDN’s design, to create a clean and inviting website that makes navigating our 44,000 articles as easy as possible. We wanted to create a more holistic experience for our users, with an emphasis on improved navigability and a universal look and feel across all our pages.

                    <span>JSON support in SQLite has been in the works for awhile now, but prior to this release you had to opt in to it. Now it’s on by default and this is a great rundown of using the query features.

                    <span>For many software folk, we prefer our networking to have TCP handshakes, not literal (or even virtual) handshakes. If that’s you, this guide might help you get over the hump:
Here’s the truth: you can get what you need from these events without being awkward or creepy. Whether that’s job leads or important connections, there is a well-defined, time-tested way to accomplish this. It will push your limits, but it won’t leave you feeling gross inside. And the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it.
