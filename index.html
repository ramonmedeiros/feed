                    <span>One of the most interesting parts of working at Google is learning what other people do here — it’s not uncommon to come across a job title you’ve never heard of. For example: ProFair Program Manager, or ProFair Analyst.
These roles are part of our Responsible Innovation team, which focuses on making sure our tech supports Google’s AI Principles. One way the team does this is by conducting proactive algorithmic product fairness — or ProFair — testing. This means bringing social and cultural perspectives to the testing process, to assess how an AI or ML application, dataset or technique might avoid reinforcing unfair bias. Three women who work on ProFair testing are Anne Peckham, N’Mah Y. and Cherish M. and today we’re asking them: What’s your job?

                    <span>John Ruble:
On any moderately-sized Node.js project you’ve likely already outgrown the package.json “scripts” section. But because the growth was gradual, with no single acute pain point, you might not have noticed. There’s a better way.
I’ve never been able to get into Makefiles, but many people I respect love them. For me the syntax is too arcane, but I recognize the power. If the “scripts” section of your package.json is getting unwieldy, it might be time for a make over. (yes I went there)

                    <span>I’ve avoided using Docker Desktop on my Mac like you avoid those 16-seeds in your March Madness bracket. Why? Because it’s dog slow. But not anymore?
The 4.6 release of Docker Desktop for Mac contains a number of changes that drastically improve file sharing performance for macOS users. Firstly, developers now have the option of using a new experimental file sharing implementation called virtiofs (the current default is gRPC-FUSE). Secondly, improvements have been made to the way that files are synced between the macOS host and Docker VM. During testing with our amazing macOS community of users, we have observed that these changes have reduced the time taken to complete filesystem operations by up to 98%.
virtiofs is an experimental feature, so you need to enable it to realize these gains.

                    <span>This piece by Aria Beingessner is incredibly relevant to our shipping-this-week episode with Brian Kernighen:
My problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.
C is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.
And just in case these pull quotes leave you with the impression that Aria is happy about the situation… yeah, nope.

Why now?
The amount of value this team has given to the web world over the years is immeasurable.
I sincerely hope DigitalOcean turns out to be a worthy new steward of this precious resource and the site’s best years are ahead of it. 🤞

In their moment, minicomputers were used in a variety of applications. They served as communications controllers, instrument controllers, large system pre-processors, desk calculators, and real-time data acquisition handlers. But they also laid the foundation for significant hardware architecture advances and contributed greatly to modern operating systems, programming languages, and interactive computing as we know them today.
We were just discussing this machine on our upcoming episode with Brian Kernighan.

                    <span>HUBFS is a file system for GitHub and Git. Git repositories and their contents are represented as regular directories and files and are accessible by any application, without the application having any knowledge that it is really accessing a remote Git repository. The repositories are writable and allow editing files and running build operations.
So if you hubfs mnt (on macOS/Linux), it will set up a file hierarchy inside /mnt that follows this pattern: / owner / repository / ref / path. Cool idea! It is affected by GitHub’s API rate limiting and I’m not sure if/how it syncs (commits) back to the remote repos…

Use conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Don’t use too many, and use the same status codes for the same outcomes across the API.
Smile Egbai had a solid rant about this on Go Time recently.

                    <span>Julia Evans lays out her process for taking API responses in her browser’s dev tools and using them in her own programs/scripts:
look in developer tools for a promising JSON response
copy as cURL
remove irrelevant headers
translate it into Python
Some of you might be wondering – can you always do this?
The answer is sort of yes – browsers aren’t magic! All the information browsers send to your backend is just HTTP requests. So if I copy all of the HTTP headers that my browser is sending, I think there’s literally no way for the backend to tell that the request isn’t sent by my browser and is actually being sent by a random Python program.

                    <span>This proposal is brand new (stage 0), but I hear that a lot of work has been put into it behind the scenes by a lot of people, so it has that going for it…
This proposal aims to enable developers to add type annotations to their JavaScript code, allowing those annotations to be checked by a type checker that is external to JavaScript. At runtime, a JavaScript engine ignores them, treating the types as comments.
The aim of this proposal is to enable developers to run programs written in TypeScript, Flow, and other static typing supersets of JavaScript without any need for transpilation, if they stick within a certain reasonably large subset of the language.
The implications of this change are pretty massive, if it were to ever ship. And you better believe we’re putting together a JS Party episode to discuss it with the people involved.

                    <span>Gary Marcus makes the case that deep learning has hit a wall:
Let me start by saying a few things that seem obvious,” Geoffrey Hinton, “Godfather” of deep learning, and one of the most celebrated scientists of our time, told a leading AI conference in Toronto in 2016. “If you work as a radiologist you’re like the coyote that’s already over the edge of the cliff but hasn’t looked down.” Deep learning is so well-suited to reading images from MRIs and CT scans, he reasoned, that people should “stop training radiologists now” and that it’s “just completely obvious within five years deep learning is going to do better.”
Fast forward to 2022, and not a single radiologist has been replaced.
But he doesn’t stop there. After laying out multiple examples of deep learning failures, he change tone:
For the first time in 40 years, I finally feel some optimism about AI.

                    <span>Posted by Adrian Taylor, Chrome Security Team
If you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like &#x27;exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild&#x27; have been appearing more often recently. In this post we&#x27;ll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We&#x27;ll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. 
How things work today 
While the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it&#x27;s because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it&#x27;s actually a good thing! I…</span>

                    <span>Jean Yang:
Should you move to serverless? Is GraphQL the answer to your API woes? Should you follow the latest DevOps playbook to increase your system reliability? In the world of tech tools, there’s a lot of buzz. But it doesn’t always reflect the daily reality of programmers.
As the founder of a developer tools startup, I’ve talked with hundreds, if not thousands, of software developers over the last few years in the course of routine user research. The common theme in these conversations, even bigger than the need for the product we were building, was an overarching need that is currently underserved: building for real developers, or what I like to call the 99% Developers.
Good stuff to be reminded of. That reminds me: You are not Google/Amazon/LinkedIn.

                    <span>Rich Burroughs:
When you hear the phrase “cloud native,” is Kubernetes the first thing that comes to your mind? It is for me, and I expect I’m not alone. Kubernetes is now the second-largest open source project after Linux, and it’s the big fish in the cloud native pond. But there are many other projects in the CNCF landscape and the broader cloud native community.
So, I thought I’d list some cloud native tools that can be very useful for teams that aren’t using Kubernetes or aren’t using it for every workload. Here are 7 of them that I like a lot.
If Rich’s name rings a bell, that’s because he was just on Ship It! last week. 😉

                    <span>Secure applications start with secure code. As organizations deploy code faster than ever, implementing continuous security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is critical to building secure products. As a long-time HackerOne Bounty customer, GitLab knows the importance of identifying and addressing bugs as early as possible in the SDLC. We wanted to hear what they had to say about leveraging the human intelligence of ethical hackers to broadly test their attack surface and increase their ability to resist potential threats.</span>

                    <span>It’s possible to pair well simply by avoiding pairing poorly.
I’ve never thought about it that way, but yeah, makes sense. What follows is a list of things not to do when pairing. Things for navigators, things for drivers, and things for both.
This is just one page from Tuple’s pair programming guide, which looks excellent all-around.

                    <span>Samuel Berthe:
This project have started as an experiment to discover generics implementation. It may look like Lodash in some aspects. I used to code with the awesome go-funk package, but it uses reflection and therefore is not typesafe.
As expected, benchmarks demonstrate that generics will be much faster than implementations based on reflect stdlib package. Benchmarks also shows similar performances to pure for loops.

                    <span>This week we have the pleasure of Rich Burroughs, Senior Developer Advocate at Loft Labs and host of the Kube Cuddle podcast.
We talk about multitenancy in Kubernetes and how to run Kubernetes in Kubernetes with vcluster. If you are using KiND, you will find this episode interesting, and maybe even helpful.
We also talk about the role that Kelsey Hightower played in Rich joining the CNCF ecosystem. The key take-away is that people make all the difference.
ADHD is something that Rich thinks about often. Gerhard was curious about the difference between ADHD and burnout, as well as this Twitter thread on re-reading sent emails.

                    <span>So Argc is a little Rust program that your bash scripts can use to make handling command-line parameters easy. You describe the options, parameters, and subcommands in comments like this:
# @describe A demo cli

# @cmd Upload a file
# @arg target!                      File to upload
upload() {
    echo &quot;cmd                       upload&quot;
    echo &quot;arg:  target              $argc_target&quot;
}

Then you trust Argc to parse that and do the heavy lifting:
eval &quot;$(argc -e $0 &quot;$@&quot;)&quot;

The only drawback (aside from potential parsing bugs) to this approach is your script now depends on having argc in the machine’s executable path. i.e. – it’s not portable.
What’d be even cooler, IMHO, would be to instead use argc as a pre-processor of sorts that spits out a pure-bash implementation from your input script. Regardless, a cool idea!

                    <span>Chris Ferdinandi:
For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!
I built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I’ve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.
Heck, even Chris’s disclaimer of ‘when SPAs make sense’ section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation. But I digress… read this post it’s a good one for sure.

                    <span>Writing high quality standards is a necessary first step to an interoperable web platform, but ensuring that browsers are consistent in their behavior requires an ongoing process. Browsers must work to ensure that they have a shared understanding of web standards, and that their implementation matches that understanding.
Interop 2022 is a cross-browser initiative to find and address the most important interoperability pain points on the web platform. The end result is a public metric that will assess progress toward fixing these interoperability issues.

                    <span>DNA is the language of life: our DNA forms a living record of things that went well for our ancestors, and things that didn’t. DNA tells our body (and every other organism) which proteins to produce; these proteins are tiny machines that carry out enormous tasks, from fighting off infection to helping you ace an upcoming exam in school.


But for about a third of all proteins that all organisms produce, we just don’t know what they do. It’s kind of like we’re in a factory where everything’s buzzing, and we’re surrounded by all these impressive tools, but we have only a vague idea of what’s going on. Understanding how these tools operate, and how we can use them, is where we think machine learning can make a big difference.

My written words are my most precious asset. They are also a history of my life. That’s why I only use plain text files. They are the most reliable, flexible, and long-lasting option. Here’s why.

A new storage engine for PostgreSQL, bringing a modern approach to database capacity, capabilities and performance to the world’s most-loved database platform.
OrioleDB consists of an extension, building on the innovative table access method framework and other standard Postgres extension interfaces. By extending and enhancing the current table access methods, OrioleDB opens the door to a future of more powerful storage models that are optimized for cloud and modern hardware architectures.

                    <span>This week we’re joined by the “mad scientist” himself, Feross Aboukhadijeh…and we’re talking about the launch of Socket — the next big thing in the fight to secure and protect the open source supply chain.
While working on the frontlines of open source, Feross and team have witnessed firsthand how supply chain attacks have swept across the software community and have damaged the trust in open source. Socket turns the problem of securing open source software on its head, and asks…“What if we assume all open source may be malicious?” So, they built a system that proactively detects indicators of compromised open source packages and brings awareness to teams in real-time. We cover the whys, the hows, and what’s next for this ambitious and very much needed project.

                    <span>Almond.CSS helps in two ways: it normalizes the CSS styles to provide similar experience cross-browser, and it spices things a little by adding custom styles (that can be personalized!)
Use the different HTML5 semantic tags on your website, include the library in your project, and let CSS and the browser work their magic. Just combine your HTML and Almond CSS (no JavaScript needed.)
Demo here. Looks like a great starter for simple side projects and the like.

                    <span>If you’ve accessed the MDN website today, you probably noticed that it looks quite different. We hope it’s a good different. Let us explain!
In mid-2021 we started to think about modernizing MDN’s design, to create a clean and inviting website that makes navigating our 44,000 articles as easy as possible. We wanted to create a more holistic experience for our users, with an emphasis on improved navigability and a universal look and feel across all our pages.

Here’s the truth: you can get what you need from these events without being awkward or creepy. Whether that’s job leads or important connections, there is a well-defined, time-tested way to accomplish this. It will push your limits, but it won’t leave you feeling gross inside. And the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it.

They have an array of open source tooling to build great apps for the terminal and Charm Cloud to power a new generation of CLI apps. We talk through all their tooling, where things are headed for CLI apps, the focus and attention of their team, and what’s to come in bringing glamor to the command line.

For a software engineer, the hardest thing about developing Machine Learning functionality should be finding clean and representative ground-truth data, but it often isn’t. If you already have a source of good quality data (perhaps because it is already gathered by your application), here are some obstacles that still lay ahead of you
From the difficult to grasp concepts to the varied (and variable quality) software you’ll need to explore and manage the data, there’s still a lot of obstacles in our path before we can put a model to good use.

It’s easy, in hindsight, to critique things CSS got wrong or should’ve prioritized differently. But I want to take a moment to marvel at the things they got right.
It’s incredibly difficult to build APIs that solve today’s problems while anticipating an unknown future. In some cases, I think the original CSS authors did precisely that.

                    <span>ngrok rocks, but it’s 2nd version is famously closed source*, so many open source alternatives have been developed over the years. So many, in fact, that they now have their own awesome list.
The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS, even if behind a NAT or other restricted network.
*We spoke with Alan Shreve about this decision back when he made it, if you’re curious about his thinking.

                    <span>I love this idea by Simon Willison:
I think I’ve come up with a novel hack for the challenge of getting your company to financially support the open source projects that it uses: reach out to the maintainers and offer them generous speaking fees for remote talks to your engineering team.
It won’t work for every person and situation, but we should add it to our arsenal of ways to return economic value back to the maintainers of our open source infrastructure.

                    <span>Last year, TikTokker Avery Steeves posted a video asking why no one talks about how there’s an entire generation of teenage girls who taught themselves to code HTML on Tumblr. “People are like, ‘Oh, there’s no girls in STEM,’” she says, imitating the faceless internet mob. “No, there were! They were just making pale blogs.”
OK so we don’t usually link to Mashable (first time ever?), but this was cool news to me, so I thought it was worth passing along. Long live HTML!

                    <span>In today’s episode, Gerhard is talking to Mauricio Salatino (@salaboy) about the Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes book that he is currently writing.
Mauricio is a Staff Engineer at VMware where he spends most of his time contributing to Knative, an open source platform for running serverless workloads on Kubernetes. Gerhard &amp; Mauricio spent a few months in 2021 working on Knative Eventing, and they both appreciate shipping great software continuously. Mauricio helped ship Knative 1.0.
The from-monolith-to-k8s application used throughout this book has been a few years in the making. It doubles-up as a workshop-style guide for rearchitecting a Java monolith to a Cloud Native architecture running in Kubernetes.

                    <span>Posted by Ard Biesheuvel, Google Open Source Security Team 

Linux kernel support for the 32-bit ARM architecture was contributed in the late 90s, when there was little corporate involvement in Linux development, and most contributors were students or hobbyists, tinkering with development boards, often without much in the way of documentation.


Now 20+ years later, 32-bit ARM&#x27;s maintainer has downgraded its support level to &#x27;odd fixes,&#x27; while remaining active as a kernel contributor. This is a common pattern for aging and obsolete architectures: corporate funding for Linux kernel development has tremendously increased the pace of development, but only for architectures with a high return on investment. As a result, the 32-bit ARM port of Linux is essentially in maintenance-only mode, and …</span>

                    <span>Adorable, operatic blobs. A global, online guessing game. Scribbles that transform into works of art. These may not sound like they’re part of a curriculum, but learning the basics of how artificial intelligence (AI) works doesn’t have to be complicated, super-technical or boring.
To celebrate Digital Learning Day, we’re releasing a new lesson from Applied Digital Skills, Google’s free, online, video-based curriculum (and part of the larger Grow with Google initiative). “Discover AI in Daily Life” was designed with middle and high school students in mind, and dives into how AI is built, and how it helps people every day.

                    <span>Knut Melvær with a thoughtful attack on one of my all-time favorite tools:
Markdown is a signifier for the developer and text-tinkerer culture. But since its introduction, the world of digital content has also changed. While Markdown is still fine for some things, I don’t believe it’s should be the go-to for content anymore.
There are two main reasons for this:
Markdown wasn’t designed to meet today’s needs of content.
Markdown holds editorial experience back.
Now, I did say it’s a thoughtful atttack and it’s also a long one (30 minute read). Knut does the work, diving deep into Markdown’s history and John Gruber’s desires for it:
I want to build my advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web. For many of us, I suspect Markdown is something we just take for granted as a “thing that exists.” But all technology has a history and is a product of human interaction. This is important to remember when you, the reader, develop technology for others to use.

                    <span>Why create another form library? Here’s what Fomir’s author says to that:
I have tried many form libraries, like redux-form, formik, final-form, react-hook-form… None of them suit my taste. I would expect a forms library with these features:
Using schema
Easy to update form state
High Performance
More abstract
Fomir create form by passing a form schema which is a JSON tree. the form schema is very flexible, you can create any form by the schema.
I could see this as especially useful for form builders and similar tools where you’re providing a graphical way to build forms because your backend would just have to emit the correct JSON and let Fomir take it from there.

                    <span>Douglas Vaghetti:
It is a good time to be in tech right now: soaring salaries, daily LinkedIn recruiter spam, people bootcamping their way into career switches to tech, remote work allowing you to work for a major tech company making triple digit salaries from the beach. It really feels like every single company is trying to recruit programmers nowadays, and doing whatever they can to get them.
I’m certainly happy with the current state of affairs, but I can’t help but wonder: How does it end?
Will supply go up via a mass influx of people switching careers? Will demand go down via AI and newly created no-code/low-code alternatives? Time will tell. But for now, some food for thought.

                    <span>Jujutsu (jj at your CLI) combines features from popular distributed version controls systems (Git, Mercurial, Darcs) with features not found in any of them, such as:
working-copy-as-commit
undo functionality
automatic rebase
safe replication via rsync/Dropbox/etc
And since it’s Git-compatible, adoption should be a breeze.
Jujutsu has two backends. One of them is a Git backend (the other is a native one). This lets you use Jujutsu as an alternative interface to Git. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits. You can always switch back to Git.
I’ve often wondered what will come next after Git. I’m not saying this is that thing, but it’s cool to see people working on the problem.

                    <span>If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this has some impacts on the code you write. If you want to keep ’em separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at your API designs in certain ways.
These are my reactions to some of the ways a value can be returned (or not).
Before you head off to read Rachel’s post, allow me to close the loop on that Offspring reference for those of us who didn’t grow up in the 90’s.

                    <span>Not much has been written yet on how Go’s fuzzing system actually works, so I’ll talk a bit about that here. If you’d like to try it out, Getting started with fuzzing is a great tutorial.
Jay Conrod worked on Go 1.18’s fuzzing feature, so there’s very few people who could write a post as detailed and accurate as this. He also discussed fuzzing in detail with us on Go Time #187.

                    <span>Regular expressions aren’t easy to write, but they’re especially hard to read. This project is yet another attempt to make them more readable and maintainable. The aim is to create a new language that compiles to regexen so we don’t have to write them directly.

As is customary around these parts, we aren’t going to write much code. Just glue it together. First up, we’ll need a handful of dependencies.
Plug, Cowboy, and extty do all the heavy lifting.

Today Laurence is a developer advocate at Google focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). “It’s my goal to inform and inspire the world about what we can do with AI and ML, and help developers realize these possibilities.” Laurence applied at Google in 2013 after hearing then-CEO Larry Page talk about Google’s vision to make the world a better place. “I was hired on my third attempt — so yes, I failed twice!”

It was 5:17pm today, just as I was wrapping up work for the day, and my manager pinged me with the following chat:
: Hi Jeremy - we have a  ticket - escalated to , , etc. 
 is on trying to advise as well. Are you available this evening if needed for diagnostics?  is on the call now
No obligation; just checking in to see what my availability is. Quickly thinking it over – I didn’t have any plans tonight, nothing in particular on my agenda. Why not? If I can help then someone else on the team won’t have to, and I don’t have anything better to do tonight.
The game is afoot. It might be a long night…
