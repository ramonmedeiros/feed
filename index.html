                <p>The motivation for building Slidev:
I always found myself spending too much time styling and layouting slides when using apps like PowerPoint / Keynote / Google Slides. Whenever I need to share code snippets, I would also need to use other tools to generate the highlighted code as images over and over again.
So as a frontend developer, why not solve it the way that fits better with what I am good at?
Looks slick: themeable, hackable, and you write your slides in Markdown. üëå

                <p>Most software companies have to make decisions on whether to build a custom software or buy it from a vendor. In the last year I read many good articles on the web that helped shape my thoughts on how to approach these discussions. This article lists of questions that I have started to use to understand and make these decisions.

                <p>This is an excellent article about understanding technical debt:
It is a fact that, over time, all development teams get slowed down by the existing codebase. But why? Is it because maintenance is inevitable? Or because we could do something better in the first place? Or both?
Luca argues that technical debt is introduced as a by-product of disagreement, which itself is a by-product of two phenomena: wrong design, and rapid evolution. Thoughtful stuff. Well worth your time.
