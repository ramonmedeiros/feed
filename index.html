                    <span>Lars is big on Elixir. Think apps that scale really well, tend to be monolithic, and have one of the most mature deployment models: self-contained releases &amp; built-in hot code reloading. In episode 7, Gerhard talked to Lars about “Why Kubernetes”. There is a follow-up YouTube stream that showed how to automate deploys for an Elixir app using K3s &amp; ArgoCD.
More than a year later, how does Lars think about running applications in production? What does simple &amp; straightforward mean to him? Gerhard’s favourite: what is “human scale deployments”?

Every system eventually sucks, get over it
Your data is the most important part of your system

                    <span>This project is from the SQLite team themselves. Their reasoning for it:
SQLite is sometimes used as the core of a client/server database system. While it works reliably well in such cases, the database backend module that it uses to store b-tree structures in its database file was not designed with this case in mind and can be improved upon in several ways. The HC-tree (hctree) project is an attempt to develop a new database backend that improves upon regular SQLite as follows…
It improves concurrency, adds support for replication &amp; removes database size limitations.

Datasette is an open source tool that takes an SQLite database and gives you an out-of-the-box, web-based UI built specifically for exploring data. Need an example? Here’s a database of all of Motley Fool’s earning transcripts that I used to look for talk of their California campaign activity. And here’s a bunch of other examples of Datasette from the official site.
And the thing is: I love Datasette. It recently turned 5 years old and I wanted to write down the thing that makes it an absolutely delightful data hammer.

                    <span>Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.
This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.
LangChain is designed to help with prompts, chains (sequences of calls), data augmented generation, agents, memory &amp; evaluation tasks.

Our development philosophies, programming habits, and soul are within this universe of Martian gems.

                    <span>Why is ML is so poorly adopted in small organizations (hint: it’s not because they don’t have enough data)? In this episode, Kirsten Lum from Storytellers shares the patterns she has seen in small orgs that lead to a successful ML practice. We discuss how the job of a ML Engineer/Data Scientist is different in that environment and how end-to-end project management is key to adoption.

                    <span>Tyler Cipriani read “‘Did you miss my comments or what?’ Understanding Toxicity in Open Source Discussions,” and learned about entitlement:
The term is new (to me), but the paper renders a familiar scene, “The author is usually visibly upset about not being able to use the tool, often complaining about wasted time.”
The situation is all-too-common and exhausting. And when it happens over-and-over, maintainers give up.
It made me wonder: why have I never seen “entitlement” in a code of conduct?
Good question…

                    <span>Alex Ewerlöf and his team implemented “Tech Debt Friday”
Engineers looked forward to the Tech Debt Friday. The team would happily remind management that this day cannot (under any circumstances) be planned for regular feature/bugfix work. Although we fixed some bugs along the way, this was primarily an investment to make future feature development cheaper while improving the maintainability and reliability.
Initially it was hard to defend spending 10% of the team bandwidth on tech debt, but over time the payback was huge
He goes on to list eight things that happened as result of this policy. Good stuff.

This strikes me as smart for Medium and a big vote of confidence for Mastodon and the entire concept of federated social networking. With Tumblr support (allegedly) coming as well, what’s next? Reddit?!

                    <span>If you are the technical co-founder or early engineering lead at a startup, and you want to talk about your microservices, hand-rolled CI/CD, in-house monitoring stack, or any other unique part of your stack, I will say: Cool. Let’s riff. Take me deep, I’m ready.
But there’s something I’m likely to tell you in return, something I’ll probably insist you’re overlooking and need to internalize as soon as possible: Your technology stack is not the product.
It’s easy to get too focused on our tech and tools. Sometimes we think it’s our competitive advantage, other times it’s merely personal fascination and intellectual stimulation. This post is a good reminder:
A mindset of technology being the means, not the end, is uncomfortable. But it will help you stay focused on what matters most (the product and your customers), avoid wasteful misadventures, and maximize the company’s chance of success.

                    <span>Paul Smith (from “Obama’s Trauma Team”) tells us the tale of how Go played a big role in the rescuing and rebuilding of the HealthCare.gov website. Along the way we learn what the original team did wrong, how the rescue team kept it afloat during huge traffic spikes, and what they’ve done since to rebuild it to serve the people’s needs.

                    <span>Scott Antipa:
I’m working on a flowchart editor that runs in the browser, and I wanted a way for people to use it without having to sign in, or store any data on our server. I wanted to give them control over their data and to be able to store it locally to open and edit later. And also easily share it with other people. It’s easy to do this by supporting file upload/download, but I wanted something simpler, like the ability to share by sending a url. I also didn’t want to store anything on the backend (at least for the free tier).
What he decided on was to base64 encode the entire application state and store it in the fragment section of the URL. I love all the upsides of this approach and it’s pretty trivial to accomplish. Here’s the pseudocode that Scott provides in his post:
const stateString &#x3D; JSON.stringify(appState); // appState is a json object
const compressed &#x3D; compress(stateString);
const encoded &#x3D; Base64.encode(compressed);
// Push that &#x60;encoded&#x60; string to the url
// ... Later, on page load or on undo/redo we read the url and
// do the following
const decoded &#x3D; Base64.decode(encoded); // same encoded as above, but read from url
const uncompressed &#x3D; uncompress(decoded);
const newState &#x3D; JSON.parse(uncompressed);
// Now load your application with the newState

                    <span>Measuring a manager’s impact is hard since outcomes take time. The manager takes full responsibility for the team - be it stagnation, execution woes, poor collaboration, churn, or a lack of focus. This post provides early evaluation metrics as well as tips for course correction.

                    <span>Cedric Chin, writing about the famous adage that says “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”
At some level, this is self-evident. Goodhart’s Law is about as pithy and about as practicable as “the only certainty in life is death and taxes” and “hell is other people.” It is descriptive; it tells you of the existence of a phenomenon, but it doesn’t tell you what to do about it or how to solve it.
There are more useful formulations of the law that help solve it. Some organizations use this narrower, more actionable form:
When people are pressured to meet a target value there are three ways they can proceed:
They can work to improve the system
They can distort the system
Or they can distort the data
With that framing in hand, Cedric goes on to describe how you can solve for these three ways and design incentive/measurement systems that work.

                    <span>Posted by Dana Jansens (she/her), Chrome Security Team  
We are pleased to announce that moving forward, the Chromium project is going to support the use of third-party Rust libraries from C++ in Chromium. To do so, we are now actively pursuing adding a production Rust toolchain to our build system. This will enable us to include Rust code in the Chrome binary within the next year. We’re starting slow and setting clear expectations on what libraries we will consider once we’re ready. 
In this blog post, we will discuss how we arrived at the decision to support third-party Rust libraries at this time, and not broader usage of Rust in Chromium. 
Why We Chose to Bring Rust into Chromium
Our goal in bringing Rust into Chromium is to provide a simpler (no IPC) and safer (less complex C++ overal…</span>

                    <span>A long-standing debate between me and a peer at work has been how we should name services. His position was always that services should be named something descriptive, so that you can infer from the name what it does. My position is that the name should definitely not be descriptive, but should be something cute and wholly disconnected from the purpose. And I think this applies more broadly to projects and companies, too.
Nicholas’ reason for cute names winning comes down to the inevitably of change in a service/project’s function and the difficulty in renaming things. I hadn’t thought of that argument, but I already agreed with the premise.
We also apply this thinking to podcast episode names, which can be a mixed bag because descriptive titles certainly help when it comes to discovery. As Adam and I discussed on our recent State of the “log” episode, if you see use a descriptive title, it’s most likely because we couldn’t think of a good cute/interesting one.
But that’s just our opinion about episode naming. What do you prefer?

                    <span>Discovering passwords in our codebase is probably one of our worst fears. But what if you didn’t need passwords at all, and could deploy to your cloud provider another way? In this post, we explore how you can use OpenID Connect to trust your cloud provider, enabling you to deploy easily, securely and safely, while minimizing the operational overhead associated with secrets (for example, key rotations).</span>

                    <span>Daniel and Chris do a deep dive into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which is the first LLM to enjoy direct mass adoption by folks outside the AI world. They discuss how it works, its effect on the world, ramifications of its adoption, and what we may expect in the future as these types of models continue to evolve.

                    <span>Thomas Depierre, writing about the concept of the Software Supply Chain in the context of open source development:
We are not suppliers. All the people writing and maintaining these projects, we are not suppliers. We do not have a business relationship with all these organisations. We are volunteers, writing code and putting it online under these Licences. And yes, we put it online for people to use them. But we do not get anything from it.
He goes on to discuss how, importantly, licenses such as the MIT point this out (in all caps):
If you use this, I owe you nothing. At all. We have no relationship. I put this up online on the condition that if you use it, all the risks are on you… So all your Software Supply Chain ideas? You are not buying from a supplier, you are a raccoon digging through dumpsters for free code. So I would advise you to put these rules in the same dumpster. And remember. I am not a supplier.
That raccoon line reminds me of a now-ancient meme you might still enjoy…

                    <span>This is a must-read thriller!
Costs were dropping by 90% as promised. He was paid 50K$. Then he disappeared. Completely.
The happy IT director wanted to give more assignments to this genius. But he vanished. Didn’t answer emails, voicemail on the phone number closed LinkedIn account. Gone.
The truth, sometimes, is stranger than fiction…

                    <span>This escalated quickly. I don’t know about you, but I’m a daily user of ChatGPT. Just yesterday, I asked “What options does Linux offer for fast RAID 0 software RAID?” and I had an entire conversation that settled on Btrfs as a good option and I learned how to create and configure the array, mount it, and most importantly scrub it for errors. I’ll still use ZFS, of course. But, I’ve never had that experience using Google (nor can you).
…according to a report by Semafor, Microsoft Corp is discussing the possibility of acquiring OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT. The tech-industry giant is ready to pay upwards of $10 billion for the acquisition.
Clearly, Microsoft sees the bigger picture here for Bing, Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, and more. This also speaks to the conversation we had with Swyx about AI’s future being tied to capitalism and eventually being controlled by the FAANGs.

                    <span>Tim McNamara makes an important distinction that is often lost on us:
Agile doesn’t make your team magically speed up its ability to close tickets. Instead, it speeds up the team’s decision-making process. It’s about orientation, not velocity. An agile workflow is one where you are able to quickly adjust direction based on short feedback cycles.
Mat, Natalie &amp; I touched on this when they dragged me on to Go Time last summer to share some thoughts on velocity. Worth a (re)listen if you’re in to such things.

                    <span>Welcome to 2023 — we’re kicking off the year talking to Justin Searls about the state of web development and why he just might write a “You Might Not Need React” post. He’s been so productive using Turbo and Stimulus (and tailwind) in Rails 7 that we had to talk about the state of Rails development today and a bunch of other fun topics around building for the web in 2023.

                    <span>Shahed Nasser shares how she and the technical writing team at Medusa went about improving their docs:
The most essential change that helped us implement all improvements is how we manage the documentation. In most software companies, documentation has less of a priority compared to the software, and it is handled as an afterthought.
At Medusa, we early on came to realize that documentation is what can actually drive further adoption of Medusa.
There’s a lot to learn from their process that you can apply to your own, but I think the biggest winner Shahed shares is the mindset change of thinking about documentation itself as a product, not as something that augments or attaches to the product.

                    <span>Sometimes all a project needs is the ability to read/write small amounts of JSON data and have it saved in some persistent storage. Imagine a simple data-model which receives infrequent updates and could be represented as JSON object. It doesn’t demand a full-blown database, but it would be neat to have a way to interact with this data and have it persist across sessions.
This is where gist-database comes in handy, by leveraging the power of the gist api you can easily create a key/value data-store for your project.
This is a perfect solution for low write / high read scenarios when serving static site content with Next.js and using Incremental Static Regeneration to keep your cached content fresh.

                    <span>A solid rundown of the discrepency between what we hope from microservices and what we often get instead. TLDR:
Architecture is hard sometimes–people keep offering up some new idea that quickly becomes the mainstream “way to do it” without any context or nuance, and the industry, desperate to find ways to improve their architecture, snaps it up without hesitation. Microservices was the latest in the trend, and it’s time we dissected the idea and got to the real root of what’s going on.

                    <span>While at EMNLP 2022, Daniel got a chance to sit down with an amazing group of researchers creating NLP technology that actually works for their local language communities. Just Zwennicker (Universiteit van Amsterdam) discusses his work on a machine translation system for Sranan Tongo, a creole language that is spoken in Suriname. Andiswa Bukula (SADiLaR), Rooweither Mabuya (SADiLaR), and Bonaventure Dossou (Lanfrica, Mila) discuss their work with Masakhane to strengthen and spur NLP research in African languages, for Africans, by Africans.
The group emphasized the need for more linguistically diverse NLP systems that work in scenarios of data scarcity, non-Latin scripts, rich morphology, etc. You don’t want to miss this one!

                    <span>We don’t normally include how-tos in Changelog News, but I’m making an exception for this post because a) it goes deep on how Docker works on macOS, and b) this is a problem that plagues so many of us that I thought it worth pointing to a solution.
There’s also a nice bit about Development Containers at the end, which are quite promising, indeed.

Here’s how Zach describes it:
The git commit graph and its relationship to common git workflows explained using simple English and easy to understand diagrams. Also some jokes.

                    <span>You’ve probably done the whole deleted_at thing to mark records as deleted without actually deleting them from the database. That strategy is fraught for a few reasons.
In this post, Brandur Leach proposes an alternative strategy with the following endorsement:
Speaking from 30,000 feet, programming is all about tradeoffs. However, this is one of those rare places where as far as I can tell the cost/benefit skew is so disproportionate that the common platitude falls flat.
Anytime your fellow developer can make that statement in earnest, whatever they’re talking about is worth a try…
