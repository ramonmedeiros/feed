If you’re building a new app today, it might be worth taking a closer look at making it cloud-native and using Kubernetes from the jump. The effort to set up Kubernetes is less than you think. Certainly, it’s less than the effort it would take to refactor your app later on to support containerization.

It includes many operator functions for arithmetic and binary operations and a couple of convenience and helper functions. They might not seem so useful, but with help of just a few of these functions you can make your code faster, more concise, more readable and more functional. So, in this article we will explore this great Python module and make the most out of the every function included in it.

A little over 10 years ago, we launched our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). Our goal was to establish a channel for security researchers to report bugs to Google and offer an efficient way for us to thank them for helping make Google, our users, and the Internet a safer place. To recap our progress on these goals, here is a snapshot of what VRP has accomplished with the community over the past 10 years:

You’re the founder of a nicely growing SaaS startup which has just raised a Series A, Series B, or Series C funding round. You need to hire rapidly to seize the opportunity. But how much should you hire, what roles should you hire, and what should the org chart look like when you’re done?

Chrome's Site Isolation is an essential security defense that makes it harder for malicious web sites to steal data from other web sites. On Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS, Site Isolation protects all web sites from each other, and also ensures they do not share processes with extensions, which are more highly privileged than web sites. As of Chrome 92, we will start extending this capability so that extensions can no longer share processes…</p>

This repo is about designing a server that fits within the 1U space and 1A @ 120v power constraint while maximizing computing power, storage, and value.

The way we design and build software is continually evolving. Just as we now think of security as something we build into software from the start, we are also increasingly looking for new ways to minimize trust in that software. One of the ways we can do that is by designing software so that you can get cryptographic certainty of what the software has done.
In this post, we'll introduce the concept of verifiable data structures that help us get this cryptograp…</p>

In this episode we are joined by Tim Heckman and Peter Bourgon to discuss some of the downsides to these changes and how it has lead to what a subset of the Go community refers to as the “v2+ problem.”

Of all the technologies and tools I’ve picked up over the course of my career, SQL has had one of the highest ROIs. It’s portable across languages/runtimes and has incredible staying power in terms of skill relevancy.

                <p>In any software project, over time new features and APIs are added and from time-to-time some of them also become deprecated and eventually get removed. Even huge project such as Kubernetes is no exception to this, yet core parts of its API don’t really come to mind when thinking about deprecating and eventual removal. So, the question is - could a core object or API in Kubernetes, such as Pod, Deployment or Service be removed and if so, how would that go?

                <p>Today, HackerOne is launching the industry’s first hacker API. This release is now out of beta and is available to the hacker community. It includes a collection of API endpoints that help automate common workflow tasks. In the past, hackers had to use the UI to complete repetitive tasks on the platform, with no supported mechanism to script or automate their workflows. With the new API, hackers can increase productivity and allocate more time towards creative bug hunting.</p>

                <p>Ellen Spertus on Stack Overflow’s blog:
While there are many resources to help programmers write better code—such as books and static analyzers—there are few for writing better comments. While it’s easy to measure the quantity of comments in a program, it’s hard to measure the quality, and the two are not necessarily correlated. A bad comment is worse than no comment at all. Here are some rules to help you achieve a happy medium.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Back in the day, there was a surefire way to tell humans and computers apart: You’d present a picture of a four-legged friend and ask if it was a cat or dog. A computer couldn’t identify felines from canines, but we humans could answer with doggone confidence. 
That all changed about a decade ago thanks to leaps in computer vision and machine learning – specifically,  major advancements in neural networks, which can train computers to learn in a way similar to humans. Today, if you give a computer enough im…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss begins where I often do when discussing estimation:
One study by HBR found that one in six IT projects had cost overruns of over 200% and were late by almost 70%. Another study by McKinsey found that IT projects are on average 45% over budget and 7% over schedule. They found large software projects were particularly bad: software projects with budgets over $15M went over budget by an overage of 66% and had schedule overruns averaging 33%.
Nonetheless, there are good reasons to estimate any…</p>

                <p>Devon Zuegel on startup cities:
While the startup cities industry is still small, it is already quite heterogeneous. Each project has its own distinct set of goals, motivations, and scope. However, this diversity isn’t fully captured by the vocabulary we use right now.
To help myself create a mental map of the industry, I’ve grouped these motivations into 5 categories. I’ve also included examples of places that personify each motivation.
She goes on to discuss each of the 5 categories: economic opportunity,…</p>

                <p>This project is a formalized list of checks that can be run against an open source codebase and a Go-based tool to run those checks and provide a report on the project’s health. Here are a few of the checks it runs, to get an idea of what it’s all about:
Does the project use fuzzing tools, e.g. OSS-Fuzz?
Does the project cryptographically sign releases?
Does the project contain a security policy?

                <p>Commit groups sounds interesting to me. Anyone reading this familiar with Git innards? Is this doable?
You know the “group” facility of vector graphics programs? You draw a couple of shapes, you group them together, and then you can apply transformations to the entire group at once, operating on it as if it were an atomic thing. But when need arises, you can “ungroup” it and look deeper.
I’d love to see that same idea applied to Git commits. In Git, a commit group might just be a named and annotated range o…</p>

                <p>Solid… does not use a Virtual DOM. Instead it opts to compile its templates down to real DOM nodes and wrap updates in fine grained reactions. This way when your state updates only the code that depends on it runs.
Solid takes a lot of cues from React, but sets itself apart in that it doesn’t use a Virtual DOM. Here’s what Michel Weststrate had to say about it on Twitter:
