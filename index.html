                    <span>You can’t build robust systems with inconsistent, unstructured text output from LLMs. Moreover, LLM integrations scare corporate lawyers, finance departments, and security professionals due to hallucinations, cost, lack of compliance (e.g., HIPAA), leaked IP/PII, and “injection” vulnerabilities.
In this episode, Chris interviews Daniel about his new company called Prediction Guard, which addresses these issues. They discuss some practical methodologies for getting consistent, structured output from compliant AI systems. These systems, driven by open access models and various kinds of LLM wrappers, can help you delight customers AND navigate the increasing restrictions on “GPT” models.

Introduction


Chrome is trusted by millions of business users as a secure enterprise browser. Organizations can use Chrome Browser Cloud Management to help manage Chrome browsers more effectively. As an admin, they can use the Google Admin console to get Chrome to report critical security events to third-party service providers such as Splunk® to create custom enterprise security remediation workflows.


Security remediation is the process of responding to security events that have been triggered by a system or a user. Remediation can be done manually or automatically, and it is an important part of an enterprise security program.


Why is Automated Security Remediation Important?


When a security event is identified, it is imperative to re…</span>

Nobody likes preventable site errors, but they happen disappointingly often. 



The last thing you want your customers to see is a dreaded &#x27;Your connection is not private&#x27; error instead of the service they expected to reach. Most certificate errors are preventable and one of the best ways to help prevent issues is by automating your certificate lifecycle using the ACME standard. Google Trust Services now offers our ACME API to all users with a Google Cloud account (referred to as “users” here), allowing them to automatically acquire and renew publicly-trusted TLS certificates for free. The ACME API has been available as a preview and over 200 million certificates have been issued already, offering the same c…</span>

                    <span>The late, great Fred Brooks wrote many words about software engineering. You may have heard of Brooks’s Law or read his seminal book, The Mythical Man-Month. Even if you haven’t, you’ve probably heard at least one colleague proclaim:
Nine women can’t make a baby in one month!
This is a powerful metaphor for two reasons. First: it’s so vivid that it’s hard to forget (and easy to recall in a time of need). Second: it makes obvious a not-so-obvious conclusion. Which is:
Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
That’s a hard pill to swallow, especially when your project is late. But it’s a truth pill, which makes it worth choking down. Here’s another truth pill that Brooks wrote in his paper No Silver Bullet–Essence and Accident in Software Engineering:

Today, we are announcing the launch of the v0.1 version of Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition (GUAC). Introduced at Kubecon 2022 in October, GUAC targets a critical need in the software industry to understand the software supply chain. In collaboration with Kusari, Purdue University, Citi, and community members, we have incorporated feedback from our early testers to improve GUAC and make it more useful for security professionals. This improved version is now available as an API for you to start developing on top of, and integrating into, your systems.

As technology continues to advance, so do efforts by cybercriminals who look to exploit vulnerabilities in software and devices. This is why at Google and Android, security is a top priority, and we are constantly working to make our products more secure. One way we do this is through our Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRP), which incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in our operating system and devices. 


We are pleased to announce that we are implementing a new quality rating system for security vulnerability reports to encourage more security research in higher impact areas of our products and ensure the security of our users.  This system will rate vulnerability reports as High, Medium, or Low quality…</span>

Google’s Open Source Security Team recently sponsored a fuzzing competition as part of ISCE’s Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT) Workshop. Our goal was to encourage the development of new fuzzing techniques, which can lead to the discovery of software vulnerabilities and ultimately a safer open source ecosystem. 



The competitors’ fuzzers were judged on code coverage and their ability to discover bugs: 

HasteFuzz took the $11,337 prize for code coverage

PASTIS and AFLrustrust tied for bug discovery and split the $11,337 prize

                    <span>Conferences are an integral part of the Go community, but the experience of conferences has remained the same even as the value propositions change. In this episode we discuss what conferences generally provide, how value propositions have changed, and what changes conference organizers could make to realign their conference experience to a new set of value propositions.

                    <span>There are a ton of problems around building LLM apps in production and the last mile of that problem. Travis Fischer, builder of open AI projects like @ChatGPTBot, joins us to talk through these problems (and how to overcome them). He helps us understand the hierarchy of complexity from simple prompting to augmentation, agents, and fine-tuning. Along the way we discuss the frontend developer community that is rapidly adopting AI technology via Typescript (not Python).

Today, we are announcing Buzzer, a new eBPF Fuzzing framework that aims to help hardening the Linux Kernel.
What is eBPF and how does it verify safety?

eBPF is a technology that allows developers and sysadmins to easily run programs in a privileged context, like an operating system kernel. Recently, its popularity has increased, with more products adopting it as, for example, a network filtering solution. At the same time, it has maintained its relevance in the security research community, since it provides a powerful attack surface into the operating system.





While there are many solutions for fuzzing vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, they are not necessarily tailored to the unique features of eBP…</span>

                    <span>This week we’re celebrating Maintainer Month along with our friends at GitHub. Open source runs the world, but who runs open source? Maintainers. Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don’t always have the community or support they need. That’s why we’re celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May. Today’s conversation features Alyssa Wright (Bloomberg), Chad Whitacre (Sentry), and Duane O’Brien (Creator of the FOSS Contributor Fund and framework). We get into all the details, the why, the hows, and the struggles involved for companies to support open source.

Safe Browsing: faster more intelligent protection


Android uses Safe Browsing to protect billions of users from web-based threats, like deceptive phishing sites. This happens in the Chrome default browser and also in Android WebView, when you open web content from apps. 


Safe Browsing is getting a big upgrade with a new real-time API that helps ensure you’re warned about fast-emerging malicious sites. With the newest version of Safe Browsing, devices will do real-time blocklist checks for low reputation sites. Our internal analysis has found that a significant number of phishing sites only exist for less than ten minutes to try and stay ahead of block-lists.

In recognition of World Password Day 2023, Google announced its next step toward a passwordless future: passkeys. 



Passkeys are a new, passwordless authentication method that offer a convenient authentication experience for sites and apps, using just a fingerprint, face scan or other screen lock. They are designed to enhance online security for users. Because they are based on the public key cryptographic protocols that underpin security keys, they are resistant to phishing and other online attacks, making them more secure than SMS, app based one-time passwords and other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA). And since passkeys are standardized, a single…</span>

Today, we are announcing the General Availability 1.0 version of rules_oci, an open-sourced Bazel plugin (“ruleset”) that makes it simpler and more secure to build container images with Bazel. This effort was a collaboration we had with Aspect and the Rules Authors Special Interest Group. In this post, we’ll explain how rules_oci differs from its predecessor, rules_docker, and describe the benefits it offers for both container image security and the container community.
