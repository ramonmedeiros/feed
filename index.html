                    <span>I thouroughly enjoyed reading this. It‚Äôs interesting to think about the evolution of transport storage. To this day, the USB thumb drive has proved to be the long-term winner and something I personally use very often. Wanna install Debian or do a clean install of macOS? You‚Äôll likely do it by creating a bootable USB thumb drive.
Before the invention of the thumb drive, computer users stored and transported their files using floppy disks. Developed by IBM in the 1960s, first 8-inch and later 5 ¬º-inch and 3 ¬Ω-inch floppy disks replaced cassette tapes as the most practical portable storage media. Floppy disks were limited by their relatively small storage capacity‚Äîeven double-sided, double-density disks could store only 1.44 MB of data. During the 1990s, as the size of files and software increased‚Ä¶
Would you be surprised to learn that the supposed inventor of the thumb drive is in jail right now in Singapore? But why?

                    <span>SQLite has few functions compared to other database management systems. SQLite authors see this as a feature rather than a problem, because SQLite has an extension mechanism in place.
There are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete, inconsistent and scattered across the internet. sqlean brings them together, neatly packaged into domain modules, documented, tested, and built for Linux, Windows and macOS.
Think of it like an extended standard library for SQLite.

One way to simplify your stack and reduce the moving parts, speed up development, lower the risk and deliver more features in your startup is ‚ÄúUse Postgres for everything‚Äù. Postgres can replace - up to millions of users - many backend technologies, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Mongo and Redis among them.
He then goes on to list nine things you can use Postgres for that replace more specific solutions: fulltext search, geospatial queries, etc.

                    <span>How will large language models (LLMs) change the world?
No one knows. With such uncertainty, a good exercise is to look for historical analogies‚Äîto think about other technologies and ask what would happen if LLMs played out the same way.
I like to keep things concrete, so I‚Äôll discuss the impact of LLMs on writing. But most of this would also apply to the impact of LLMs on other fields, as well as other AI technologies like AI art/music/video/code.
What follows are 13 examples of technological innovations that changed the world and description of how they affected they way people work. Here‚Äôs an example analogy of Feet and Segways:
First, there was walking. Then the Segway came to CHANGE THE NATURE OF HUMAN TRANSPORT. Twenty years later, there is still walking, plus occasionally low-key alternatives like electric scooters.
In this analogy, LLMs work fine but just aren‚Äôt worth the trouble in most cases and society doesn‚Äôt evolve to integrate them. Domain-specific LLMs are used for some applications, but we start to associate ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù LLMs with tourists and mall cops. George W. Bush falls off an LLM on vacation and everyone loses their minds.

We care deeply about privacy. We also know that trust is built by transparency. This blog, and the technical paper reference within, is an example of that commitment: we describe an important new Android privacy infrastructure called Private Compute Core (PCC). 
Some of our most exciting machine learning features use continuous sensing data ‚Äî information from the microphone, camera, and screen. These features keep you safe, help you communicate, and facilitate stronger connections with people you care about. To unlock this new generation of innovative concepts, we built a specialized sandbox to privately process and protect this data.

This blog post details an exploit for CVE-2022-42703 (P0 issue 2351 - Fixed 5 September 2022), a bug Jann Horn found in the Linux kernel&#x27;s memory management (MM) subsystem that leads to a use-after-free on struct anon_vma. As the bug is very complex (I certainly struggle to understand it!), a future blog post will describe the bug in full. For the time being, the issue tracker entry, this LWN article explaining what an anon_vma is and the commit that introduced the bug are great resources in order to gain additional context.
Setting the scene
Successfully triggering the underlying vulnerability causes folio-&gt;mapping to point to a freed anon_vma object. Calling madvise(..., MADV_PAGEOUT)can then be used to repeatedly trigger accesses to the freed anon_vma in foli‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>OpenAI recently released a model for automatic speech recognition called Whisper. I decided to reimplement the inference of the model from scratch using C/C++. To achieve this I implemented a minimalistic tensor library in C and ported the high-level architecture of the model in C++. The entire code is less than 8000 lines of code and is contained in just 2 source files without any third-party dependencies.
State of the art voice recognition without any PyTorch baggage and it‚Äôs optimized to run on Apple Silicon!

The preso is average, but the Q&amp;A near the end is above average, if you ask me. OH! And also we got Zoom bombed twice, which was a first for me. Thankfully, it was also a last. So far, at least‚Ä¶

                    <span>Simon Willison is using this year‚Äôs Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn Rust.
He‚Äôs using Copilot to help him with syntax/snippets via comment-driven prompting. He‚Äôs using ChatGPT as a study partner by asking it questions about how to do things in Rust. Is it working?
So far I think this is working really well.
I feel like I‚Äôm beginning to get a good mental model of how Rust works, and a lot of the basic syntax is beginning to embed itself into my muscle memory.
The real test is going to be if I can first make it to day 25 (with no prior Advent of Code experience I don‚Äôt know how much the increasing difficulty level will interfere with my learning) and then if I can actually write a useful Rust program after that without any assistance from these AI models.
And honestly, the other big benefit here is that this is simply a lot of fun. I‚Äôm finding interacting with AIs in this way‚Äîas an actual exercise, not just to try them out‚Äîis deeply satisfying and intellectually stimulating.
This might be an early glimpse into the future of AI-assisted learning‚Ä¶

                    <span>Posted by Jeffrey Vander Stoep 
For more than a decade, memory safety vulnerabilities have consistently represented more than 65% of vulnerabilities across products, and across the industry. On Android, we‚Äôre now seeing something different - a significant drop in memory safety vulnerabilities and an associated drop in the severity of our vulnerabilities. 
  
Looking at vulnerabilities reported in the Android security bulletin, which includes critical/high severity vulnerabilities reported through our vulnerability rewards program (VRP) and vulnerabilities reported internally, we see that the number of memory safety vulnerabilities have dropped considerably over the past few years/releases. From 2019 to 2022 the annual number of memory safety vulnerabilities dropped from 223 down to 85.

                    <span>Burnout has reportedly reached a critical point in the software developer circle since the onset of the Covid-19 health crisis. A recent study by Haystack Analytics, a company specializing in productivity of engineers, found that 83% of software developers suffer from burnout. The main reasons given by the latter to explain this exhaustion are high workload (47%), process inefficiency (31%) and lack of clarity of objectives and targets (29%).

                    <span>Jake Lazaroff spent the last few months learning Tailwind with an open mind and he‚Äôs ready to share his opinion of the popular CSS framework:
Tailwind is commonly described as ‚Äúutility classes‚Äù, but that‚Äôs a bit of an understatement. It‚Äôs essentially a small language you write in the class attributes of your HTML that compiles to a combination of CSS rules and selectors ‚Äî an abstraction over CSS. But all abstractions leak, and Tailwind is very leaky.
When an abstraction leaks, it means you still have to be aware of (and sometimes deeply so) the underlying layer that‚Äôs being abstracted. In this case, Jake is saying that you still need to know CSS to use Tailwind and lays out a few scenarios in which this is the case.
This might be unfair to Tailwind. To my knowledge, the team has never promoted it as a CSS replacement. At its core, it really is just a set of class names that apply styles. But even after working with it for months, there‚Äôs still a mental translation layer between ‚ÄúTailwind CSS‚Äù and ‚Äúreal CSS‚Äù.

                    <span>There are some big AI-related controversies swirling, and it‚Äôs time we talk about them. A lawsuit has been filed against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI related to Copilot code suggestions, and many people have been disturbed by the output of Meta AI‚Äôs Galactica model. Does Copilot violate open source licenses? Does Galactica output dangerous science-related content? In this episode, we dive into the controversies and risks, and we discuss the benefits of these technologies.

                    <span>Ruby 3.1 adds a new core class called Data to represent simple immutable value objects. The Data class helps define simple classes for value-alike objects that can be extended with custom methods.
While the Data class is not meant to be used directly, it can be used as a base class for creating custom value objects. The Data class is similar to Struct, but the key difference being that it is immutable.
In its heyday, most Rubyists wouldn‚Äôt touch immutability with a ten-foot pole. Times, they are a changin‚Äô‚Ä¶

I hesitated writing this post, because I don‚Äôt want to start, or get into, a holy war over programming languages. (Just to get the flame bait out of the way, Visual Basic is the best language ever!) But I‚Äôve had a number of people ask me about my experience with Rust and whether they should pick up Rust for their projects. So, I‚Äôd like to share some of the pros and cons that I see of using Rust in a startup setting, where moving fast and scaling teams is really important.
The learning curve and hiring difficulties seem to be the major culprits, in Matt‚Äôs experience.

                    <span>A team without a proven observability strategy will invariably suffer from reactive disruptions; mitigating outages will be painful, like finding a needle in a haystack while blindfolded. This post describes a battle-proven strategy for ensuring full observability coverage.

                    <span>Why another file manager? I wanted something simple and minimalistic. Something to help me with faster navigation in the filesystem; a cd and ls replacement. So I build ‚Äúllama‚Äù. It allows for quick navigation with fuzzy searching. cd integration is quite simple. And you can open vim right from the llama. That‚Äôs it. As simple and dumb as a llama.

                    <span>An interesting idea from Gustav Westling‚Ä¶
One of the things that I like to do in my projects, is to make the git history as linear as possible.
Usually this means to rebase commits onto the main branch, but it can also mean to only allow merges in one direction, from feature branches into main, never the other way around. It kind of depends on the project.
Today I‚Äôm taking this one step further, and I‚Äôm introducing a new concept: extremely linear git history.
With our extremely linear history, the first commit in a repo hash a hash that starts with 0000000, the second commit is 0000001, the third is 0000002, and so on!
How he accomplishes this is perhaps even more interesting (and hacky!)

                    <span>Matthew Tejo:
Twitter supposedly lost around 80% of its work force. What ever the real number is, there are whole teams with out engineers on it now. Yet, the website goes on and the tweets keep coming. This left a lot wondering what exactly was going on with all those engineers and made it seem like it was all just bloat. I‚Äôd like to explain my little corner of Twitter (though it wasn‚Äôt so little) and some of the work that went on that kept this thing running.
This is a detailed post about Twitter‚Äôs caching system that Matthew and others built while working there, and it‚Äôs brilliantly summed up by commenter Johnny Manu40:
When everything works fine, they wonder why they hired you. When everything stops working, they wonder why they hired you. I.T. in a nutshell.

I‚Äôve become convinced that ‚Äúlittle languages‚Äù‚Äîsmall languages designed to solve very specific problems‚Äîare the future of programming, particularly after reading Gabriella Gonzalez‚Äôs The end of history for programming and watching Alan Kay‚Äôs Programming and Scaling talk.
Examples of ‚Äúlittle languages‚Äù include SQL and regular expressions. In the old days we called these DSLs, but the author argues that term has become overloaded and I have a hard time disagreeing with that.

                    <span>Homebrew creator Max Howell is back with a brand new invention:
tea is a standalone, binary download for all platforms that puts the entire open source ecosystem at your fingertips. Casually and effortlessly use the latest and greatest or the oldest and most mature from any layer of any stack. Break down the silos between programming communities, throw together scripts that use entirely separate tools and languages and share them with the world with a simple one-liner.
All you need is tea.
Bold! I love how many interesting ideas are packed in to this project: pipelines, universal virtual-env, executable markdown‚Ä¶ the list goes on. Check out the README for all the deets. My big question is: might Max and the team be thinking too big this time around?

Today‚Äôs anthology episode from ATO features: Arun Gupta (VP and GM of Open Ecosystem Initiatives at Intel), long-time friend Chad Whitacre (Head of Open Source at Sentry), and Ricardo Sueiras (Principal Advocate in Open Source at AWS)
The common denominator for each of these conversations is advocating for and supporting open source. Special thanks to Todd Lewis and team for inviting us to come back to ATO. We enjoyed meeting long time fans and new ones too.

                    <span>In your company, who designs the end-to-end developer experience? From design to implementation, what is the developer experience that you actually ship? Even though the average developer wastes almost half of their working hours because of bad DX, many of us don‚Äôt even know what that means, or how to improve it.
Kenneth Auchenberg is working at Stripe, building economic infrastructure for the internet. Gerhard found his perspective on Developer Experience Infrastructure (DXI) refreshingly simple, as well as very useful.

                    <span>Kubernetes v1.25 introduced Container Checkpointing API as an alpha feature. This provides a way to backup-and-restore containers running in Pods, without ever stopping them.
This feature is primarily aimed at forensic analysis, but general backup-and-restore is something any Kubernetes user can take advantage of.
So, let‚Äôs take a look at this brand-new feature and see how we can enable it in our clusters and leverage it for backup-and-restore or forensic analysis.

                    <span>As the old saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In the software world, an open source alternative is the sincerest form of imitation. Well, Retool (a Changelog sponsor) can consider themselves flattered, because Openblocks sets out to do openly what they‚Äôve been doing proprietarily. Here‚Äôs why:
It‚Äôs cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.
Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.
Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.
Openblocks wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Openblocks is
An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.
A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
A domain-specific language that UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.

                    <span>Technology has an unmistakable impact on society ‚Äî the way we work, learn and play have all changed significantly over the past decade. As SVP of Technology and Society, part of my work at Google is connecting people and ideas to help shape the future of our most ambitious technology and its impact on society, and to do it responsibly.


An important part of that is talking to and learning from experts in a variety of fields and disciplines. Recently I sat down with a brilliant friend, New York Times columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman, to compare notes and discuss some big questions on our minds.




Thomas Friedman and James Manyika in conversation at Google‚Äôs Bay View campus.



We had a lot to cover, as it had been a couple of years since our last such in-person conversation due to the pandemic. Much of our discussion focused on AI and how it affects society, but we also discussed what Tom has been observing, how we as a society shape technology, and why we think this moment in time is an inflection point akin to the printing press or the industrial revolution.


To close our conversation, I asked Tom what keeps him optimistic about the future. His answer reinforces my belief that getting technology right is a collective responsibility involving the whole of society ‚Äî from open, honest conversations like this to better understand the opportunities and challenges, to defining policy, and responsibly creating new and societally-beneficial applications.


I always learn something new when I have these conversations with Tom, and I‚Äôm excited to share more insights and dialogues on YouTube soon.

                    <span>Might a ‚Äúmodular monolith‚Äù be the happy middle ground in the endless monolith or microservices decision? You may have to answer that question for yourself, but this post shares some good thoughts around designing a modular monolith:
When designing a modular monolith, it is all about breaking up the system into modules, and then combining those modules into a monolith for deployment.
It might be worth noting that finding what modules you will need, might not be as easy as you would think. They have to be as independent as possible. High-cohesion and low coupling is very important here, as all communication between the modules might end up being a cross network call, if you decide to break it into services in the future.
This means that all communication between modules need to well abstracted, and be either asynchronous, so that they can handle the call going across the network in the future, or use some form of messaging.

                    <span>Let‚Äôs see if this ages well, but I do agree that Armin shares some good points. Scale comes with mainstream, and mainstream Mastodon isn‚Äôt quite possible if we can‚Äôt all agree (and we can‚Äôt). This is probably Mastodon‚Äôs most obvious achilles heel ‚Äî agreement in a decentralized, federated, you can ‚Äúdo what you want‚Äù world.
‚Ä¶before we even hit the issue of the technology, we hit the issue of there being absolutely no agreement of what the thing should look like or what the issue actually is and that‚Äôs I think much more interesting.
Some people claim the solution to the technical scalability issue is huge instances, some other people have the belief that the actual intended design and solution were micro-instances of in extreme cases a user each.
Then there‚Äôs moderation, which if you‚Äôve ever run any community forums, Slacks, etc you‚Äôll know that you‚Äôre going to have to moderate and deal with people problems.
On the topic of moderation the very same issue is even more absurd. Some instances want uncontrolled free speech where some instances effectively are pure shit-posting instances which are completely de-federated from the most of the fediverse as a result. Other instances really like to control their content, where some popular ones such as fosstodon ban all languages than English as a result to allow moderation. There also is no real agreement on if larger or smaller instance are going to make the problem of moderation better or worse.

                    <span>In 2018, we launched Google‚Äôs AI Principles to ensure we‚Äôre building AI that not only solves important problems and helps people in their daily lives, but also AI that is ethical, fair and safe. At the same time, we launched a central Responsible Innovation team to ensure the rest of Google is held accountable to these AI Principles. As the team grows, we continue to incorporate the perspectives and ideas of people from around the world ‚Äî and this spring we welcomed our first intern, Lieke Dom. Lieke is based in Amsterdam, recently got her Master‚Äôs in Digital Business &amp; Innovation, and is completing her Master‚Äôs in Applied Ethics.


I sat down with Lieke to learn more about her experience so far, including how her educational career led her here and what she‚Äôs learned from the internship.
