                    <span>Fresh is in the “SSR with client-side progressive enhancement” camp. I have to admit their list of ‘stand out’ features are quite appealing:
No JS is shipped to the client by default
No build step
No configuration required
TypeScript support out of the box
If you’re feeling some JavaScript and/or Framework Fatigue, this won’t help. But competition pushes everyone (Next, Remix, etc) to improve. So, whether you check Fresh out or not, hopefully it’ll have a positive impact on your work.

                    <span>This week Jesse Grosjean joins us to talk about his career as a solo indie Mac dev. Since 2004 Jesse has been building Mac apps under the company name Hog Bay Software producing hits such as WriteRoom, Taskpaper, and now Bike. We talk through the evolution of his apps, how he considers new features and improvements, why he chose and continues to choose the Mac platform, his business model and pricing for his apps, and what it takes to build his business around macOS and the driving force of the App Store.

                    <span>I won’t call SQLite’s current moment a comeback, because the most used database engine in the world doesn’t have anything to come back from. I’m going with “renaissance”, because despite its already mass adoption, there has been something of a rebirth of interest from one software sector that had previously relegated it to dev &amp; test environments1: web apps
We asked SQLite creator Richard Hipp about his database’s gap in penetration back when we first told the story of SQLite’s success in 2016:
Now for a website where you’ve got a lot of write concurrency, you need to move to a client-server database engine because you need that server process there to coordinate the concurrency… There’s just no way to do that in a serverless database like SQLite. So for so many things you don’t have that …</span>

                    <span>Nolan Lawson:
Anyone who’s worked in the tech industry for long enough, especially at larger organizations, has seen it before. A legacy system exists: it’s big, it’s complex, and no one fully understands how it works. Architects are brought in to “fix” the system. They might wheel out a big whiteboard showing a lot of boxes and arrows pointing at other boxes, and inevitably, their solution is… to add more boxes and arrows. Nobody can subtract from the system; everyone just adds.
Nolan posits the center cannot hold and the current market shift from bull to bear might help bring the collapse of complex software. But it’s never that simple, is it?
One thing working in complexity’s favor, though, is that engineers like complexity. Admit it: as much as we complain about other people’s complexity, we love our own. We love sitting around and dreaming up new architectural diagrams that can comfortably sit inside our own heads – it’s only when these diagrams leave our heads, take shape in the real world, and outgrow the size of any one person’s head that the problems begin.

                    <span>At Google we use technologies like machine learning (ML) to build more useful products — from filtering out email spam, to keeping maps up to date, to offering more relevant search results. Chrome is no exception: We use ML to make web images more accessible to people who are blind or have low vision, and we also generate real-time captions for online videos, in service of people in noisy environments, and those who are hard of hearing.
This work in Chrome continues, so we wanted to share some recent and future ML improvements that offer a safer, more accessible and more personalized browsing experience. Importantly: these updates are powered by on-device ML models, which means your data stays private, and never leaves your device.

                    <span>DALL-E can generate some amazing results, but we’re still in a phase of AI’s progress where having humans involved in the process is just better. Here’s how the authors of this workflow explain it:
Generative art is a creative process. While recent advances of DALL·E unleash people’s creativity, having a single-prompt-single-output UX/UI locks the imagination to a single possibility, which is bad no matter how fine this single result is. DALL·E Flow is an alternative to the one-liner, by formalizing the generative art as an iterative procedure.

                    <span>GitHub will archive all projects under the Atom org on December 15, 2022. Why?
Atom has not had significant feature development for the past several years, though we’ve conducted maintenance and security updates during this period to ensure we’re being good stewards of the project and product. As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we’ve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.
Atom was co-founder and long-time CEO Chris Wanstrath’s baby. We first heard its story from project lead Nathan Sobo on The Changelog back in 2017. Here’s what he had to say about the end of Atom’s era:
As Atom’s sun sets, Zed’s sun is rising. We’re not done here.

                    <span>Injection vulnerabilities result from insecure handling of user inputs. They are relatively simple to fix once the underlying issues that cause them are understood, and are frequently found by experienced reviewers who know what to look for. The prevalence of injection vulnerabilities today is one of the best arguments for continuing to perform code review in many organizations—this type of vulnerability is most frequently caught through human inspection of the offending code.</span>

We cover self-updating GitLab &amp; ArgoCD, Maikel’s thinking behind dev environment setup and a Kubernetes workshop that he is preparing for his team. The goal is to function as a true DevOps team with shared responsibilities.
This conversation started as a thread in our community Slack - link in the show notes. Thank you Maikel for being a long-time Changelog listener and for reaching out to us - we enjoyed telling this story.

What’s crazy is dot deepfakes don’t require any additional training. 🤯

                    <span>Lars Wikman on the history of ID3 tags:
If you were a Winamp user back in the day, or curate an MP3 collection currently, you might recognize the humble ID3 tag. It is what the metadata in the MP3 file is made up of. First it was pretty limited in the version later dubbed ID3v1. Like any good 2.0 they added a ton more fields, features, removed character limits and it was suddenly ID3v2. The latest spec is ID3v2.4 while the most commonly adopted one seems to be ID3v2.3. I recently found myself having a reason to dig into this specification.
I wonder what reason he might have to dig into this spec? Could it be for a soon-to-be-announced collab with his friends at Changelog? 😏
This post is not about the technical intricacies of the format… This is about a simpler time, where people saw the wild possibilities of music on computers and when people cared about files, damnit. This is about some of the most interesting and entertaining things I’ve run across while reading the spec.

                    <span>One of the smaller (but big for webdevs) announcements from yesterday’s WWDC keynote was Web Push coming to Safari. It’s built on three web standards all working together. What does it do, well it enables websites to “notify their users of time-sensitive or high-priority events, even if the user does not currently have the site open.”
As long as you’ve coded your web application to the standards you will be able to reach Safari 16 users on macOS Ventura. You don’t need to join the Apple Developer Program to send Web Push notifications.
That’s good news, but is this feature something users want? I can think of zero websites that I’ve allowed to send me notifications even when Safari is open, let alone when I’m not even browsing the web.
Jen Simmons posted a nice thread on Twitter alongside the announcement and fielded many people’s questions/concerns along the way.

                    <span>In this “fully connected” episode of the podcast, we catch up on some recent developments in the AI world, including a new model from DeepMind called Gato. This generalist model can play video games, caption images, respond to chat messages, control robot arms, and much more. We also discuss the use of AI in the entertainment industry (e.g., in new Top Gun movie).

                    <span>Christopher Meiklejohn has been working for two years on developing an automated resilience testing tool called Filibuster and was able to test it out at DoorDash during his research internship:
Access to DoorDash’s real-world industrial microservice application was extremely valuable both to ensure that Filibuster’s design matches how microservice applications are developed today and to influence future features that I would not have identified in a lab setting.
The results were pretty good! Maybe we won’t need chaos monkeys as tools like Filibuster advance?
In short, Filibuster can identify many of the technical resilience issues that exist in applications earlier, at the time of development, without testing in production as required in more traditional chaos engineering techniques.

                    <span>Pretty much any developer or engineer uses professional tools at work: code editors, graphic designers, word processors, and so on. But designing UIs for these kinds of tools is quite a different beast from the UI design involved with software and applications intended for “everyday” audiences.
In this article, we undertake a high-level analysis on some of those differences, and examine some do’s and don’t’s for designing developer tool interfaces.

I pity the fool who upgraded last Fall and can think of zero good reasons to spend another pile of cash at the Apple Store right now no matter how hard he tries to drum up literally any valid reason why that would be a wise decision but if he could think of one he totally would do it and now maybe he’s just waiting for someone else to come up with some sort of justification for doing exactly that. I pity that fool 😉

                    <span>Victor Engmark thinks we should start test names with “should” for a handful of reasons, here’s a few:
It removes redundancy, because the function name should already be in the call stack.
It is falsifiable, a person reviewing the test can decide to which degree the name agrees with the actual test.
It encourages testing one property of the function per test
I don’t disagree, but I like to take it a step further: Let the “should” be implied by the rest of the test name.
Instead of: should replace children when updating instance
I prefer: replaces children when updating instances
Instead of: should apply discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
I prefer: applies discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
Most of Victor’s reasons for using “should” still apply with this format, but it’s less verbose and more accurately describes the software working as expected when the tests pass.

                    <span>Adam was invited by our friends at Square to interview Jack Dorsey as part of their annual developer conference called Square Unboxed. Jack Dorsey is one of the most prolific CEOs out there — he’s a hacker turned CEO and is often working at the very edge of what’s to come (at scale). Jack is focused on what the future has to offer, he’s considered an innovator by many. He’s also a Bitcoin maximalist and has positioned himself and Block long on Bitcoin.
What you’re about to hear is the fireside chat Adam had with Jack at Square Unboxed 2022. Jack and Adam discuss the vision Square has for the developer platform and why it’s so central to the company’s strategy.

                    <span>Connect’s creators call it a “better gRPC”, but I am in no position to evaluate that claim so I will leave it as an exercise for you. Here’s what they have to say about it:
Connect is production-ready — focused, simple, and debuggable — and it’s fully compatible with gRPC clients and servers. If you’re frustrated by the complexity and instability of today’s gRPC libraries, we think you’ll find Connect a breath of fresh air.
Go library out now. Connect for TypeScript is “coming soon”

The VSCodium project exists so that you don’t have to download+build from source.

They also have various package managers covered, so you can brew install --cask vscodium, etc.

                    <span>I entered Rust four years ago. To this moment, I co-authored teloxide and dptree, wrote several publications and translated a number of language release announcements. I also managed to write some production code in Rust, and had a chance to speak at one online meetup dedicated to Rust. Still, from time to time I find myself disputing with Rust’s borrow checker and type system for no practical reason. Yes, I am no longer stupefied by such errors as cannot return reference to temporary value – over time, I developed multiple heuristic strategies to cope with lifetimes…
But one recent situation has made me to fail ignominiously.

                    <span>Posted by Harshvardhan Sharma, Information Security Engineer, Google 

2021 was another record-breaking year for our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). We paid a total of $8.7 million in rewards, our highest amount yet. 2021 saw some amazing work from the security research community. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the reports we received were for findings in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. It is heartening to see an increasing number of talented researchers getting involved in cloud security.
We first announced the GCP VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of GCP, in turn helping us make GCP more secure for our users, customers, and the internet at large. Even 3 years into the program, the submissions we are getting never cea…</span>

Return values from different expressions in a with block can only be distinguished by the shape of the data returned. This creates ambiguity in with’s else clauses that make code harder to understand and more challenging to modify correctly.
The author describes the problem in detail and even provides two alternatives to with..else that avoid the resulting ambiguity.

Every now and again I come across some discussion on making Emacs “modern”.1 The argument always go more or less like this - Emacs doesn’t look and behave like  and the world will end if we don’t copy something “crucial” from it…
If you ask me - there’s pretty much nothing we can do that would suddenly make Emacs as popular as VS Code. But you know what - that’s perfectly fine. After all there are plenty of “modern” editors that are even less popular than Emacs, so clearly being “modern” doesn’t make you popular. And there’s also our “arch-nemesis” vim, that’s supposedly as “dated” as Emacs, but is extremely popular.

The cheat system cuts to the chase. You don’t have to piece together clues about how to use a command. You just follow the examples. Of course, for complex commands, it’s not a shortcut for a thorough study of the actual documentation, but for quick reference, it’s as fast as it gets.

                    <span>Accessing a major critical infrastructure network is very appealing to cybercriminals, as they can maximize societal impact and demand large ransom sums to fix tampered systems. With recent high-profile attacks, including that against the Colonial Pipeline in March 2021, it has become clear that the organizations handling critical infrastructure networks are now in the firing line. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to both threat groups that are evolving their tactics and public scrutiny if they do not remain transparent when an attack occurs.</span>

                    <span>When we had Paul Copplestone from Supabase on The Changelog I asked him what a cloud native Postgres would look like. He replied,
Decoupled compute and storage. So the idea is that you should be able to attach the compute part of it to a storage, hopefully like an infinite storage; you know, anything that is infinitely scalable. If you can do this, and in particular, if the compute can start up very fast, maybe in, say, a hundred milliseconds via some sort of HTTP response, then that’s cloud native, yeah.
Enter Neon, which sells itself as:
The multi-cloud fully managed Postgres with a generous free tier. We separated storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage.
Behind this new business from MemSQL co-founder Nikita Shamgunov is the linked (Apache-licensed) server written in Rust.

                    <span>Spoiler alert: it’s a Pi-hole
How does the Pi Hole work though? The Pi Hole answers your computer’s DNS queries and if it is a domain on the blacklist, it sends the request to the Pi Web server.  This Web server just serves up a blank page.  So instead of loading the ad from the real domain, the blank page from the Pi is downloaded, thus “blocking” the ad or metric.
How effective is the setup, in practice?
Statistically speaking our household is averaging 15% of queries blocked and a spike over a bad weather weekend of 30% blocked. It is scary and incredible to think the number of ads and metrics forced upon us, and this number continues to increase. I am delighted with the Pi Hole project and am recommending it to all.

                    <span>This week we’re peeking into the future again — this time we’re looking at the future of modern code review and workflows around pull requests. Jerod and Adam were joined by two of the co-founders of Graphite — Tomas Reimers and Greg Foster.
Graphite is an open-source CLI and code review dashboard built for engineers who want to write and review smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster. We cover all the details – how they got started, how this product emerged from another idea they were working on, the state of adoption, why stacking changes is the way of the future, how it’s just Git under the hood, and what they’re doing with the $20M in funding they just got from a16z.

                    <span>Last week I logged the very impressive Imagen project, which smarter people than me have said is the SOTA for text-to-image synthesis. Now a WIP implementation is just a pip install imagen-pytorch away.
Architecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.

DuckDuckGo, the privacy centric search firm have been found to be allowing Microsoft trackers through their browser. It’s dishonest, and I’m really disappointed.
Noteworthy: this is the DDG browser, which I’ve never used. Not the search engine. But still, this is concerning like Kev says:
DuckDuckGo tout themselves as being highly transparent and privacy respecting in everything they do. So to discover that they have been keeping this tidbit of information from their users — one that goes against the very fibre of the company — is a little concerning for me.

If you prefer, you can experiment with the latest 3.39.0 code directly in your web-browser and without having to download or install anything by visiting sqlite.org/fiddle/. (The page name is by analogy to sites like “JSFiddle” and “SQLFiddle”.)
The page runs a WASM-compiled copy of a recent 3.39.0 build in a sandbox in your web browser. Using controls on that page, you can import database files from your local machine (assuming they aren’t too big), work with them, then export any changes back to your desktop.

In this article, I try to share some of the techniques I have used in such investigations, which gave me great help in such scenarios. I hope they are helpful to you (if you did not use them already). And, if you have techniques of your own, share them!

                    <span>Ken Kantzer was part of ~20 code audits of companies that had just raised their A or B rounds of funding:
It was fascinating work – we dove deep on a great cross-section of stacks and architectures, across a wide variety of domains. We found all sorts of security issues, ranging from catastrophic to just plain interesting. And we also had a chance to chat with senior engineering leadership and CTOs more generally about the engineering and product challenges they were facing as they were just starting to scale.
In this post he shares some of the more surprising things he’s learned from the experience. There’s a lot to digest in this post, but I’ll highlight my favorite to whet your whistle:
Simple Outperformed Smart. As a self-admitted elitist, it pains me to say this, but it’s true: the startups we audited that are now doing the best usually had an almost brazenly ‘Keep It Simple’ approach to engineering. Cleverness for cleverness sake was abhorred. On the flip side, the companies where we were like ”woah, these folks are smart as hell” for the most part kind of faded.

Memory safety in Chrome is an ever-ongoing effort to protect our users. We are constantly experimenting with different technologies to stay ahead of malicious actors. In this spirit, this post is about our journey of using heap scanning technologies to improve memory safety of C++.




Let’s start at the beginning though. Throughout the lifetime of an application its state is generally represented in memory. Temporal memory safety refers to the problem of guaranteeing that memory is always accessed with the most up to date information of its structure, its type. C++ unfortunately does not provide such guarantees. While there is appetite for different languages than C++ with stronger memory safety guarantee…</span>

Flat file web software is about having a set up which doesn’t use a “traditional” database. Instead it uses plain text files, other files, and/or maybe something like a json feed to store the data.
In this post, he explains why he thinks flat file web software is on the come up (again):
Flat file software can be powerful. Depending on what you need. And I think with the right developers and brain power behind the movement it can be more scalable and secure. The sky’s the limit. When I hear a developer saying, no, flat file isn’t good because… really all I’m hearing is they don’t want to change the way web software works. Because what I’ve found is most anything is possible.
Here’s a couple of flat file platforms which are incredible. One is a CMS/blog, the other a forum. Yes, a flat file forum.

                    <span>Google researchers are giving DALL-E a run for its money:
Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model.

                    <span>This package wraps the graphql-go/graphql implementation to provide a “fluent” pattern for constructing GraphQL queries in Go. This can be valuable in situations where dynamic queries are desired: when the fields of a GraphQL query (or mutation) are not known until runtime. For most other use cases, plain query strings or a helper library such as this should be sufficient.
I wonder if this would change Mislav’s unpopular GraphQL/Go opinion…

                    <span>Chris Kiehl hits his hammer right on the head of this common sentiment in software circles:
Developers from certain languages [Java] have learned to wield this design principle with more power than many others. It’s how we end up with so much stuff in code bases that’s just… there. Existing. Superficially it appears unused, but silently and stoically, we know it protects us from the turbulent future change which lurks ever ahead.
The antithesis of one of my favorite design principles: YAGNI

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Bruce Schneier — cryptographer, computer security professional, privacy specialist, and writer (of many books). He calls himself a “public-interest technologist”, a term he coined himself, and works at the intersection of security, technology, and people.
Bruce has been writing about security issues on his blog since 2004, his monthly newsletter has been going since 1998, he’s a fellow and lecturer at Harvard’s Kennedy School, a board member of the EFF, and the Chief of Security Architecture at Inrupt. Long story short, Bruce has credentials to back up his opinions and on today’s show we dig into the state of cyber-security, security and privacy best practices, his thoughts on Bitcoin (and other crypto-currencies), Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid project, and of course…</span>

                    <span>Today we are at KubeCon CloudNativeCon EU 2022, talking to Adolfo García Veytia about securing Kubernetes releases. Adolfo is a Staff Software Engineer at Chainguard, and one of the technical leads for SIG release, meaning that he helps ship Kubernetes. You most likely know him as Puerco, and have seen first-hand his passion for securing software via SBOMs, cosign and SLSA. Puerco’s love for bikes and Chainguard are a great match 🚴‍♂️

Before delving into some of the accessibility features our teams have been building, I want to share how we’re working to be more inclusive of people with disabilities to create more accessible tools overall.

This container isn’t meant to address the same breadth of problems that Linux containers target. Its emergence is a result of its simplicity. It minimizes the boilerplate for web service business logic. It shares concepts with the browser and reduces the concepts that the programmer needs to know.
People like Ryan and his colleagues at Deno are exploring this future, but it’s not quite here yet.

                    <span>Connor Sears, founder and CEO of Rewatch, joins Adam to share the journey of creating Rewatch. What began inside of GitHub to help them thrive and connect is now available to every product team on the planet. Rewatch lets teams save, manage, and search all their video content so they can collaborate async and with greater flexibility. We talk about where the tool’s inspiration came from (spoiler alert, inside GitHub it was called GitHub TV which you’ll hear during the show), how teams leverage video to reduce the constraints of communication, how Connor and his co-founder knew they had product-fit and how they grew the team and product, and of course the flip side of that — we talk about some of Connor’s failures along the way, and knowing when it’s the right time to take a big swing.

                    <span>CloudNativePG is distributed under the Apache License 2.0, and is now owned and governed by a newly formed community of contributors to the project, built on solid principles and values inspired by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
Among these are openness, fairness, inclusivity, technical excellence, “community over product/company,” built-in quality and built-in security. I’m part of the initial group of maintainers of the project, currently made up by the top six committers of the project within EDB.
If you’ve been following Ship It’s Kaizen episodes, you know we had troubles running Postgres in K8s and recently moved to a managed (sorta) database. I wonder if Gerhard will be tempted to try this operator out anyhow…

                    <span>Curl creator/maintainer Daniel Stenberg is writing a book. It’s (aptly) named: Uncurled
Because of my background and life with Open Source and probably a lot because of the relative success some of my projects have had, I frequently get questions about subjects related to maintaining Open Source. How to run a project and what makes them succeed? For a long time I have been collecting lessons from my life with Open Source into a list of advice for fellow Open Source library hackers. This document is my attempt to convert those thoughts and experiences into words.
I don’t believe it’s finished, but there’s a lot here already! Excited for this and while it’s a free to read GitBook right now, I hope it ends with some kind of physical manifestation.

At the KubeCon EU 2022 conference in Valencia, security researchers from Palo Alto Networks presented research findings on “trampoline pods”—pods with an elevated set of privileges required to do their job, but that could conceivably be used as a jumping off point to gain escalated privileges.
The research mentions GKE, including how developers should look at the privileged pod problem today, what the GKE team is doing to minimize the use of privileged pods, and actions GKE users can take to protect their clusters.
Privileged pods within the context of GKE security

While privileged pods can pose a security issue, it’s important to look at them within the overall context of GKE security. To use a privileged pod as a “trampoline” in GKE, …</span>

                    <span>I had the honor of joining Robby Russell (who you may remember from Oh My Zsh) on his Maintainable podcast for a super-fun discussion on well-maintained software. Here’s how Robby describes it:
Robby has a chat with Jerod Santo, the Managing Editor and Partner of Changelog Media. Jerod helps lead and co-host Changelog’s flagship podcast, The Changelog, and builds all the cool stuff that makes Changelog awesome. Jerod shares his journey from being a typical networking engineer (Infosec) to the experienced programmer that he is today and his programming wisdom from the trenches.
Tune in as he highlights the undeniable importance of automated test suites and code readability, describes the arc of an engineer’s career, and talks about the past experiences that make him lean more towards clarity over cleverness when coding. He also shares some of the things engineers should consider in regard to pulling in third-party code or writing from scratch, and so much more. Enjoy!
Thanks for having me, Robby! 💚

Here’s what it comes down to: teams perform well when successes are shared and failures are owned… We don’t celebrate successes enough, and part of that (I think) is caused by the feeling of pressure that comes from working on a project that seems dooomed to fail without meticulous and ever-present attention.
He goes on to delve in to the source(s) of engineering failures, the dangers of “brightsizing”, known predictors for project success, and a bunch of related topics. Lots to ponder here alongside James, who’s seen a lot of software projects live &amp; die during his eight years in the business.

                    <span>WANT!
Framework has created a really slick, fully user serviceable, laptop and have recently started selling the mainboard as a SBC for general use.  To better support folks who may want to integrate it into their projects, they are also releasing technical documentation including  pinouts, cad models and other resources.
When they reached out and explained their plans and offered to let me play with one, I jumped at the chance and this is what I came up with after some experimentation.
