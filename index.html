                    <span>Phlex views are “plain old Ruby objects” — templates are methods and HTML tags are method calls. If you know how to define a class with a method that calls another method, you know how to use Phlex.
When it comes to API usability, Ruby is so tough to beat. This looks actually fun to use!

                    <span>How will large language models (LLMs) change the world?
No one knows. With such uncertainty, a good exercise is to look for historical analogies—to think about other technologies and ask what would happen if LLMs played out the same way.
I like to keep things concrete, so I’ll discuss the impact of LLMs on writing. But most of this would also apply to the impact of LLMs on other fields, as well as other AI technologies like AI art/music/video/code.
What follows are 13 examples of technological innovations that changed the world and description of how they affected they way people work. Here’s an example analogy of Feet and Segways:
First, there was walking. Then the Segway came to CHANGE THE NATURE OF HUMAN TRANSPORT. Twenty years later, there is still walking, plus occasionally low-key alternatives like electric scooters.
In this analogy, LLMs work fine but just aren’t worth the trouble in most cases and society doesn’t evolve to integrate them. Domain-specific LLMs are used for some applications, but we start to associate “general” LLMs with tourists and mall cops. George W. Bush falls off an LLM on vacation and everyone loses their minds.

We care deeply about privacy. We also know that trust is built by transparency. This blog, and the technical paper reference within, is an example of that commitment: we describe an important new Android privacy infrastructure called Private Compute Core (PCC). 
Some of our most exciting machine learning features use continuous sensing data — information from the microphone, camera, and screen. These features keep you safe, help you communicate, and facilitate stronger connections with people you care about. To unlock this new generation of innovative concepts, we built a specialized sandbox to privately process and protect this data.

This blog post details an exploit for CVE-2022-42703 (P0 issue 2351 - Fixed 5 September 2022), a bug Jann Horn found in the Linux kernel&#x27;s memory management (MM) subsystem that leads to a use-after-free on struct anon_vma. As the bug is very complex (I certainly struggle to understand it!), a future blog post will describe the bug in full. For the time being, the issue tracker entry, this LWN article explaining what an anon_vma is and the commit that introduced the bug are great resources in order to gain additional context.

                    <span>OpenAI recently released a model for automatic speech recognition called Whisper. I decided to reimplement the inference of the model from scratch using C/C++. To achieve this I implemented a minimalistic tensor library in C and ported the high-level architecture of the model in C++. The entire code is less than 8000 lines of code and is contained in just 2 source files without any third-party dependencies.
State of the art voice recognition without any PyTorch baggage and it’s optimized to run on Apple Silicon!

The preso is average, but the Q&amp;A near the end is above average, if you ask me. OH! And also we got Zoom bombed twice, which was a first for me. Thankfully, it was also a last. So far, at least…

                    <span>Simon Willison is using this year’s Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn Rust.
He’s using Copilot to help him with syntax/snippets via comment-driven prompting. He’s using ChatGPT as a study partner by asking it questions about how to do things in Rust. Is it working?
So far I think this is working really well.
I feel like I’m beginning to get a good mental model of how Rust works, and a lot of the basic syntax is beginning to embed itself into my muscle memory.
The real test is going to be if I can first make it to day 25 (with no prior Advent of Code experience I don’t know how much the increasing difficulty level will interfere with my learning) and then if I can actually write a useful Rust program after that without any assistance from these AI models.
And honestly, the other big benefit here is that this is simply a lot of fun. I’m finding interacting with AIs in this way—as an actual exercise, not just to try them out—is deeply satisfying and intellectually stimulating.
This might be an early glimpse into the future of AI-assisted learning…

The two of them gave the most amazing KubeCon NA Keynote last month: What a RUSH! Let’s Deploy Straight to Production!
So how do we create an Internal Development Platform that enables anyone on the team to deploy straight to production with the confidence that everything will just work?

Go frameworks exist, but none provides a feature set like frameworks from other languages. This won’t change soon.
You may think that it’s because the Go ecosystem is younger. But there is a more important factor. Go is built around the Unix Philosophy…

                    <span>Posted by Jeffrey Vander Stoep 
For more than a decade, memory safety vulnerabilities have consistently represented more than 65% of vulnerabilities across products, and across the industry. On Android, we’re now seeing something different - a significant drop in memory safety vulnerabilities and an associated drop in the severity of our vulnerabilities. 
  
Looking at vulnerabilities reported in the Android security bulletin, which includes critical/high severity vulnerabilities reported through our vulnerability rewards program (VRP) and vulnerabilities reported internally, we see that the number of memory safety vulnerabilities have dropped considerably over the past few years/releases. From 2019 to 2022 the annual number of memory safety vulnerabilities dropped from 223 down to 85.

                    <span>Burnout has reportedly reached a critical point in the software developer circle since the onset of the Covid-19 health crisis. A recent study by Haystack Analytics, a company specializing in productivity of engineers, found that 83% of software developers suffer from burnout. The main reasons given by the latter to explain this exhaustion are high workload (47%), process inefficiency (31%) and lack of clarity of objectives and targets (29%).
That few?! 😏

                    <span>Jake Lazaroff spent the last few months learning Tailwind with an open mind and he’s ready to share his opinion of the popular CSS framework:
Tailwind is commonly described as “utility classes”, but that’s a bit of an understatement. It’s essentially a small language you write in the class attributes of your HTML that compiles to a combination of CSS rules and selectors — an abstraction over CSS. But all abstractions leak, and Tailwind is very leaky.
When an abstraction leaks, it means you still have to be aware of (and sometimes deeply so) the underlying layer that’s being abstracted. In this case, Jake is saying that you still need to know CSS to use Tailwind and lays out a few scenarios in which this is the case.
This might be unfair to Tailwind. To my knowledge, the team has never promoted it as a CSS replacement. At its core, it really is just a set of class names that apply styles. But even after working with it for months, there’s still a mental translation layer between “Tailwind CSS” and “real CSS”.

                    <span>There are some big AI-related controversies swirling, and it’s time we talk about them. A lawsuit has been filed against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI related to Copilot code suggestions, and many people have been disturbed by the output of Meta AI’s Galactica model. Does Copilot violate open source licenses? Does Galactica output dangerous science-related content? In this episode, we dive into the controversies and risks, and we discuss the benefits of these technologies.

                    <span>Ruby 3.1 adds a new core class called Data to represent simple immutable value objects. The Data class helps define simple classes for value-alike objects that can be extended with custom methods.
While the Data class is not meant to be used directly, it can be used as a base class for creating custom value objects. The Data class is similar to Struct, but the key difference being that it is immutable.
In its heyday, most Rubyists wouldn’t touch immutability with a ten-foot pole. Times, they are a changin’…

                    <span>If you’ve ever had to split a string into sentences, you may have reached for a naive regular expression:
&#x27;Hello! How are you?&#x27;.split(/[.!?]/);

Instead of giving yourself two problems, Stefan Judis says maybe reach for Intl.Segmenter, which he shows is quite sophisticated and supported everywhere but Firefox.

                    <span>This week we’re back talking to Gergely Orosz — this time not quite about the insane tech hiring market, but more so the flip side, the 180, the not so good tech hiring market, the layoff market and what you can expect. There’s a lot of FUD out there, so hopefully this show gives you a lens into what’s really going on, and what to really expect. Maybe more so, how to keep your job or find a new job. We come to this topic with great compassion and great understanding, so please…there is a community here for you. There’s a lot of people in our Slack. Call it your home, it’s free to join and everyone is welcome.

                    <span>Matt Welsh:
I hesitated writing this post, because I don’t want to start, or get into, a holy war over programming languages. (Just to get the flame bait out of the way, Visual Basic is the best language ever!) But I’ve had a number of people ask me about my experience with Rust and whether they should pick up Rust for their projects. So, I’d like to share some of the pros and cons that I see of using Rust in a startup setting, where moving fast and scaling teams is really important.
The learning curve and hiring difficulties seem to be the major culprits, in Matt’s experience.

So I build “llama”. It allows for quick navigation with fuzzy searching. cd integration is quite simple. And you can open vim right from the llama. That’s it. As simple and dumb as a llama.

                    <span>An interesting idea from Gustav Westling…
One of the things that I like to do in my projects, is to make the git history as linear as possible.
Usually this means to rebase commits onto the main branch, but it can also mean to only allow merges in one direction, from feature branches into main, never the other way around. It kind of depends on the project.
Today I’m taking this one step further, and I’m introducing a new concept: extremely linear git history.
With our extremely linear history, the first commit in a repo hash a hash that starts with 0000000, the second commit is 0000001, the third is 0000002, and so on!
How he accomplishes this is perhaps even more interesting (and hacky!)

                    <span>Matthew Tejo:
Twitter supposedly lost around 80% of its work force. What ever the real number is, there are whole teams with out engineers on it now. Yet, the website goes on and the tweets keep coming. This left a lot wondering what exactly was going on with all those engineers and made it seem like it was all just bloat. I’d like to explain my little corner of Twitter (though it wasn’t so little) and some of the work that went on that kept this thing running.
This is a detailed post about Twitter’s caching system that Matthew and others built while working there, and it’s brilliantly summed up by commenter Johnny Manu40:
When everything works fine, they wonder why they hired you. When everything stops working, they wonder why they hired you. I.T. in a nutshell.

I’ve become convinced that “little languages”—small languages designed to solve very specific problems—are the future of programming, particularly after reading Gabriella Gonzalez’s The end of history for programming and watching Alan Kay’s Programming and Scaling talk.
Examples of “little languages” include SQL and regular expressions. In the old days we called these DSLs, but the author argues that term has become overloaded and I have a hard time disagreeing with that.

                    <span>Homebrew creator Max Howell is back with a brand new invention:
tea is a standalone, binary download for all platforms that puts the entire open source ecosystem at your fingertips. Casually and effortlessly use the latest and greatest or the oldest and most mature from any layer of any stack. Break down the silos between programming communities, throw together scripts that use entirely separate tools and languages and share them with the world with a simple one-liner.
All you need is tea.
Bold! I love how many interesting ideas are packed in to this project: pipelines, universal virtual-env, executable markdown… the list goes on. Check out the README for all the deets. My big question is: might Max and the team be thinking too big this time around?

Let’s set the stage, here’s what we like do when we go to conferences — we setup our podcast studio at our booth where all the other vendors are and we talk to everyone we can. We give out t-shirts, stickers, pins, high fives…and it’s a blast.
Today’s anthology episode from ATO features: Arun Gupta (VP and GM of Open Ecosystem Initiatives at Intel), long-time friend Chad Whitacre (Head of Open Source at Sentry), and Ricardo Sueiras (Principal Advocate in Open Source at AWS)
The common denominator for each of these conversations is advocating for and supporting open source. Special thanks to Todd Lewis and team for inviting us to come back to ATO. We enjoyed meeting long time fans and new ones too.

                    <span>In your company, who designs the end-to-end developer experience? From design to implementation, what is the developer experience that you actually ship? Even though the average developer wastes almost half of their working hours because of bad DX, many of us don’t even know what that means, or how to improve it.
Kenneth Auchenberg is working at Stripe, building economic infrastructure for the internet. Gerhard found his perspective on Developer Experience Infrastructure (DXI) refreshingly simple, as well as very useful.

Developer Experience is the new hot thing, and we now see many existing teams re-labeled as Dev Experience. What does DX really mean, and what is the relationship between developer relations, advocacy, DX, and product teams?

Today, I am publishing the Distributed Computing Manifesto, a canonical document from the early days of Amazon that transformed the architecture of Amazon’s ecommerce platform. It highlights the challenges we were facing at the end of the 20th century, and hints at where we were headed.
25 years later. This is super cool!

                    <span>Kubernetes v1.25 introduced Container Checkpointing API as an alpha feature. This provides a way to backup-and-restore containers running in Pods, without ever stopping them.
This feature is primarily aimed at forensic analysis, but general backup-and-restore is something any Kubernetes user can take advantage of.
So, let’s take a look at this brand-new feature and see how we can enable it in our clusters and leverage it for backup-and-restore or forensic analysis.

                    <span>As the old saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In the software world, an open source alternative is the sincerest form of imitation. Well, Retool (a Changelog sponsor) can consider themselves flattered, because Openblocks sets out to do openly what they’ve been doing proprietarily. Here’s why:
It’s cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.
Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.
Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.
Openblocks wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Openblocks is
An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.
A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
A domain-specific language that UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.

We’ve worked with this community firsthand for the last decade and have witnessed their effectiveness and ingenuity. We’ve also learned a lot while helping organizations engage the world’s largest community of ethical hackers. 

Today, we’re pleased to announce a new tool to align your program with the state-of-the-art and signal your program maturity: Program Levels, a structured framework that lets programs level up by publicly committing to certain best practices.</span>

                    <span>Technology has an unmistakable impact on society — the way we work, learn and play have all changed significantly over the past decade. As SVP of Technology and Society, part of my work at Google is connecting people and ideas to help shape the future of our most ambitious technology and its impact on society, and to do it responsibly.


An important part of that is talking to and learning from experts in a variety of fields and disciplines. Recently I sat down with a brilliant friend, New York Times columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman, to compare notes and discuss some big questions on our minds.




Thomas Friedman and James Manyika in conversation at Google’s Bay View campus.



We had a lot to cover, as it had been a couple of years since our last such in-person conversation due to the pandemic. Much of our discussion focused on AI and how it affects society, but we also discussed what Tom has been observing, how we as a society shape technology, and why we think this moment in time is an inflection point akin to the printing press or the industrial revolution.


To close our conversation, I asked Tom what keeps him optimistic about the future. His answer reinforces my belief that getting technology right is a collective responsibility involving the whole of society — from open, honest conversations like this to better understand the opportunities and challenges, to defining policy, and responsibly creating new and societally-beneficial applications.


I always learn something new when I have these conversations with Tom, and I’m excited to share more insights and dialogues on YouTube soon.

                    <span>Might a “modular monolith” be the happy middle ground in the endless monolith or microservices decision? You may have to answer that question for yourself, but this post shares some good thoughts around designing a modular monolith:
When designing a modular monolith, it is all about breaking up the system into modules, and then combining those modules into a monolith for deployment.
It might be worth noting that finding what modules you will need, might not be as easy as you would think. They have to be as independent as possible. High-cohesion and low coupling is very important here, as all communication between the modules might end up being a cross network call, if you decide to break it into services in the future.
This means that all communication between modules need to well abstracted, and be either asynchronous, so that they can handle the call going across the network in the future, or use some form of messaging.

This end product took some engineering, and the linked post goes deep into all the steps Fathy had to take along the way. From taking the picture to rendering to SVG to supporting shadows and more.

                    <span>Let’s see if this ages well, but I do agree that Armin shares some good points. Scale comes with mainstream, and mainstream Mastodon isn’t quite possible if we can’t all agree (and we can’t). This is probably Mastodon’s most obvious achilles heel — agreement in a decentralized, federated, you can “do what you want” world.
…before we even hit the issue of the technology, we hit the issue of there being absolutely no agreement of what the thing should look like or what the issue actually is and that’s I think much more interesting.
Some people claim the solution to the technical scalability issue is huge instances, some other people have the belief that the actual intended design and solution were micro-instances of in extreme cases a user each.
Then there’s moderation, which if you’ve ever run any community forums, Slacks, etc you’ll know that you’re going to have to moderate and deal with people problems.
On the topic of moderation the very same issue is even more absurd. Some instances want uncontrolled free speech where some instances effectively are pure shit-posting instances which are completely de-federated from the most of the fediverse as a result. Other instances really like to control their content, where some popular ones such as fosstodon ban all languages than English as a result to allow moderation. There also is no real agreement on if larger or smaller instance are going to make the problem of moderation better or worse.

At the same time, we launched a central Responsible Innovation team to ensure the rest of Google is held accountable to these AI Principles. As the team grows, we continue to incorporate the perspectives and ideas of people from around the world — and this spring we welcomed our first intern, Lieke Dom. Lieke is based in Amsterdam, recently got her Master’s in Digital Business &amp; Innovation, and is completing her Master’s in Applied Ethics.


I sat down with Lieke to learn more about her experience so far, including how her educational career led her here and what she’s learned from the internship.

I truly loathe Markdown. Truly. But given the widespread use of Markdown, it might seem strange that I have such aversion to it. If you somehow really like it, or are so used to it by now, you might be tempted to think I’m the oddball. But I’m definitely not alone in my dislike of the format…
It’s popular and got a lot wrong, but also a lot right. 🤔

                    <span>This week we’re back for part 2 with Adam Wiggins — going beyond Heroku and the story of Muse (listen to part 1). After a six-year adrenaline high on Heroku, Adam needed time to recover and refill the creative well. So, he moved to Berlin, did some gig work with companies…dabbled in investing and advising. But he wasn’t satisfied. Adam likes to build things.
Ultimately, he was just waiting for the right time to reconnect with James Lindenbaum and Orion Henry — the same fellas he created Heroku with. Eventually they founded Ink &amp; Switch, an independent research lab which led to innovations that made Muse possible. Muse is a tool for deep work and thinking on iPad and Mac. Today’s show is all about that journey and the details in-between.

This is all stored locally and end-to-end encrypted for syncing to to all your other computers. All of this is easily queryable via the hishtory CLI. This means from your laptop, you can easily find that complex bash pipeline you wrote on your server, and see the context in which you ran it.

                    <span>Russ Cox, for the Go team:
Today we celebrate the thirteenth birthday of the Go open source release. The Gopher is a teenager!
It’s been an eventful year for Go. The most significant event was the release of Go 1.18 in March, which brought many improvements but most notably Go workspaces, fuzzing, and generics.
He goes on to describe many of the other notable features and events of the past year and closes with a glance into Go’s future:
In Go’s 14th year, we’ll keep working to make Go the best environment for software engineering at scale. We plan to focus particularly on supply chain security, improved compatibility, and structured logging, all of which have been linked already in this post. And there will be plenty of other improvements as well, including profile-guided optimization.
