                <p>This week on Ship It! Gerhard talks with Ben Ford, former Royal Marine and founder of Commando Development, about the OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act). Shipping is just a small part of it. The OODA loop that you know is probably the wrong one. We explore Mission &amp; Command, Situational Awareness and a few other practices that will help you deal with complexity as you code and ship. As a former Royal Marine Commando, Ben learned these skills the hard way, and then refined them over many years as a…</p>

                <p>Boring avatars is a tiny JavaScript React library that generates custom, SVG-based, round avatars from any username and color palette.
Cool, but it’d be even cooler if it detached from React so we could all use it. It’d also be nice if you could opt to having the initials overlay the gradient.

While this may be the easiest way to get up and running, I’d still advise checking out Algo VPN as well since it’s also pretty easy and has been designed/configured with maximum security in mind. Still, this looks cool and the web admin UI makes it quite approachable as well.

              <summary>rpg-cli —your filesystem as a dungeon!</summary>
              <div class="details-content">
                <p>rpg-cli is a bare-bones JRPG-inspired terminal game written in Rust. It can work as an alternative to cd where you randomly encounter enemies as you change directories.
You’ll want to practice a bit first, then once you get good at it go ahead and override the builtin cd by adding this function to your bash profile.
cd () {
   rpg-cli &quot;$@&quot;
   builtin cd &quot;$(rpg-cli --pwd)&quot;
}

                <p>Today we’re sharing a special crossover episode from The Changelog podcast here on Practical AI. Recently, Daniel Whitenack joined Jerod Santo to talk with José Valim, Elixir creator, about Numerical Elixir. This is José’s newest project that’s bringing Elixir into the world of machine learning.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Thibault Meunir writing on Cloudflare’s blog:
Based on our data, it takes a user on average 32 seconds to complete a CAPTCHA challenge. There are 4.6 billion global Internet users. We assume a typical Internet user sees approximately one CAPTCHA every 10 days.
This very simple back of the envelope math equates to somewhere in the order of 500 human years wasted every single day — just for us to prove our humanity.
They aren’t just doing napkin math, they’re also trying to fix things:

                <p>Like any web browser, Firefox loads code from untrusted and potentially hostile websites and runs it on your computer. To protect you against new types of attacks from malicious sites and to meet the security principles of Mozilla, we set out to redesign Firefox on desktop.
The post Introducing Firefox&#8217;s new Site Isolation Security Architecture appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</p>

                <p>Ashley Kolodziej speaking directly to HTML:
You are the foundation of the Internet. You are the bridge between humans and information. When we say HTML isn’t an expertise in and of itself, when we take you for granted, we leave behind the people and systems who access that information using web crawlers and accessibility technology.
and CSS:
There is a time and place for specificity, and I cherish your ability to manage that. I love your system of overrides, of thinking ahead to what should and shouldn’t be…</p>

                <p>It’s fun seeing the proliferation of TODO comments over time on these bastions of open source. One not-surprising (but still unfortunate) trend: they all pretty much move up and to the right 📈, but a few have had some dramatic reversals 📉 at certain points in time. Go had a crazy month in April 2018 &amp; TypeScript’s TODOs exploded in the Spring of 2018.

This collaboration between GitHub and NASA confirmed nearly 12,000 people contributed code, documentation, graphic design, and more to the open source software that made Ingenuity’s launch possible. Today’s show is a celebration of this human achievement and the impact of open source on space exploration as we know it.

Good app structure improves the developer experience. It can help you isolate what they are working on without needing to keep the entire codebase in your head. A well structured app can help prevent bugs by decoupling components and making it easier to write useful tests.

                <p>Hidde de Vries takes a strong, reasoned stance to online criticism of others’ work:
This week, a friend shared a blog post that critiqued a popular framework for CSS. Twitter started to discuss if it’s okay to criticise tools. In this post, I’ll say it is not just okay, it is also important.
This is a tough subject because we identify so closely with the things we create (our code), but Hidde is right: if we want to progress as an industry (and individually) we need to be able to criticize (constructively) …</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Posted by Ivan Lozano, Android Team

The Android team has been working on introducing the Rust programming language into the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) since 2019 as a memory-safe alternative for platform native code development. As with any large project, introducing a new language requires careful consideration. For Android, one important area was assessing how to best fit Rust into Android’s build system. Currently this means the Soong build system (where the Rust support resides), but these desi…</p>

So I paired all day, most days, for about five years. This had a lot of upsides, far more than I can list here. There’s a standard list of benefits and drawbacks to pairing that you might be familiar with, but the impact of pairing, especially pairing that much, goes much deeper than its impact on the code, on the particular work the team delivers that week.

Many great Phoenix LiveView examples exist. They often show the ease and power of LiveView but stop at multiple browsers talking to a single web server.

Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they’re proposed by reasonable domain experts. If the person proposing the idea is reasonable, then they know how implausible it sounds. And yet they’re proposing it anyway. That suggests they know something you don’t. And if they have deep domain expertise, that’s probably the source of it.

                <p>The motivation for building Slidev:
I always found myself spending too much time styling and layouting slides when using apps like PowerPoint / Keynote / Google Slides. Whenever I need to share code snippets, I would also need to use other tools to generate the highlighted code as images over and over again.
So as a frontend developer, why not solve it the way that fits better with what I am good at?
Looks slick: themeable, hackable, and you write your slides in Markdown. 👌
