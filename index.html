The Linux 5.20 merge window will open following the release of Linux 5.19 stable around the end of July, so at that point we‚Äôll see if the Rust PR is submitted and lands for this next kernel version. It wouldn‚Äôt be too surprising with how things have been pacing and already having the blessing of Linus.
Lots of positivity about this in the attached comment thread.

Or a picture of two robots having a romantic evening at the movies? These might sound far-fetched, but a novel type of machine learning technology called text-to-image generation makes them possible. These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.
Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models ‚Äî Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches.

What do Rosemary and Rob think about committing encrypted secrets into a repository? How do they suggest that we improve on storing secrets in LastPass? And if we were to choose HashiCorp Vault, what do we need to know?
Thank you Thomas Eckert for the intro. Thank you Nabeel Sulieman (ep. 46) &amp; Kelsey Hightower (ep. 44) for your gentle nudges towards improving our infra secrets management.

                    <span>Building products is a difficult and time-consuming effort. Figuring out what the problems, finding a potential solution to that problem, and then building that solution all take a decent chunk of time and effort. It‚Äôs due to this process that the minimum viable product was born. The motivation for building an MVP is still valid. Build something small and easy to test, launch quickly, and pivot or trash it if it doesn‚Äôt perform as desired.
There is another, less selfish way.
I read an article by Jason Cohen a few years ago which changed the way I think about product development. Instead of building MVPs, we should be building SLCs. Something Simple, Loveable, and Complete.

                    <span>AppleInsider explains Apple‚Äôs new Private Access Tokens (PAT) tech announced at WWDC:
Using a new HTTP authentication method called PrivateToken, a server uses cryptography to verify a client passed an iCloud attestation check.
When the client needs a token it contacts an attester ‚Äî in this case, Apple ‚Äî which performs the process using certificates stored in the device‚Äôs Secure Enclave.
I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to kill CAPTCHAs for us, but this will be an Apple-only solution for now:
The company is working to help make Private Access Tokens a web standard, but there is no mention of tokens working on Android or Windows. People on those platforms may have to put up with CAPTCHAs, for now ‚Äî or wait for Microsoft‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs work on the matter.
I believe this is the draft of the standard that they‚Äôre referring to. Cloudflare also has a nice article on their work in this space.

                    <span>Tauri is an app framework built with Rust. You build UIs for it using virtually any frontend JavaScript framework. It has three major tenets: security, privacy, and environment. Speaking to the latter:
The apps you make are lean and performant, which reduces electricity, storage space, and general natural resource consumption. Every byte saved is a leaf on a tree that gets to grow.
This project has gotten a lot of early interest because, well, people have been waiting for an Electron alternative to emerge. Now that Tauri is 1.0 I‚Äôm guessing adoption will really start to take off.
Even more good news: we have an episode on Tauri in the hopper for ya üí™

                    <span>Many organizations such as Commoncrawl, WebRecorder, Archive.org and libraries around the world, use the warc format to archive and store web data.
The full datasets of these services range in the few pebibytes(PiB), making them impractical to query using non-distributed systems.
This project aims to make subsets such data easier to access and query using SQL.
Crawl a site with wget and import it into WarcDB:
wget --warc-file changelog &quot;https://changelog.com&quot;

warcdb import archive.warcdb changelog.warc.gz

Then you can query away using SQL, such as this one to get all response headers:
sqlite3 archive.warcdb &lt;&lt;SQL
select  json_extract(h.value, &#x27;$.header&#x27;) as header, 
        json_extract(h.value, &#x27;$.value&#x27;) as value

This time, we talk about a database built for observability: FrostDB, formerly known as ArcticDB. eBPF generates a lot of high cardinality data, which requires a new approach to writing, persisting &amp; then reading back this state.
TL;DR FrostDB is sub zero cool &amp; well worthy of its name.

In trying to get a particularly tricky habit to stick, I tried dozens of apps and nothing worked for me. Recording an action felt like yet another chore. None could approach the most basic satisfaction of simply crossing out an item on a list.
Could you design a simple action that felt as satisfying and infuse it with as much symbolism? Were we about to redesign the checkbox?
I think you know where this is headed.
The end result is quite satisfying, but the journey through their design process is just ü§å

                    <span>Zach Leatherman breaks down what SSR means in various contexts (component frameworks, app frameworks. Here‚Äôs the gist, but the details are good to so def read Zach‚Äôs full post:
Application frameworks most often define SSR as the alternative to SSG (static site generation). A runtime server is used to render the components on request.
Component frameworks define SSR as generating static HTML from a component definition. They offer no preference as to whether this should or can happen at build time or at request-time.

                    <span>Chain-bench is an open source tool for auditing your software supply chain stack for security compliance based on a new CIS Software Supply Chain benchmark.
You can run the tool from a CLI, assuming your code is hosted on GitHub (more SCM hosts coming soon):
chain-bench scan --repository-url  --access-token  -o 

I couldn‚Äôt find a comprehensive list of what checks are in the benchmark, but it appears they are referring to this guide. You can see what an example run‚Äôs results like like in the README.

                    <span>Samuel Aboagye is a genius. Aboagye is 17 years old. In those 17 years, he‚Äôs crafted more inventions than you have, probably. Among them: a solar-powered bike and a Bluetooth speaker, both using recycled materials. We caught up with Aboagye over video chat in hopes that he‚Äôd talk with us about his creations, and ultimately how he‚Äôs way cooler than any of us at 17.
The post Hacks Decoded: Bikes and Boomboxes with Samuel Aboagye appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</span>

                    <span>Could we create a digital human that processes data in a variety of modalities and detects emotions? Well, that‚Äôs exactly what NTT DATA Services is trying to do, and, in this episode, Theresa Kushner joins us to talk about their motivations, use cases, current systems, progress, and related ethical issues.

                    <span>Sid and the GitLab team continue to enjoy their Rails-based ‚Äúmodular monolith‚Äù
A modular monolith is the exact opposite of a distributed ball of mud: a well-structured, well-architected, highly modular program that runs as a single process and is as boring as possible.
Sid doesn‚Äôt pull any punches. No regrets!
Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to have a proper plugin interface? Or better yet, a services interface modeled on microservices? In a word: no. Not only do these approaches impose deployment and integration hurdles that go far beyond ‚ÄúI made a small change to the source code,‚Äù they often enforce architectural constraints too rigidly. Anticipating all the future extension points is a fool‚Äôs errand, one that we luckily did not embark on and do not have to.

The past year has seen an industry-wide effort to embrace Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)‚Äîa list of all the components, libraries, and modules that are required to build a piece of software. In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what‚Äôs in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it‚Äôs impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components‚Äîincluding those produced by others. This increased interest in SBOMs saw another boost after the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its Secure Software Development Framework, which requires SBOM information t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>An ever-expanding attack surface is a global concern for most organizations and complicates an M&amp;A, especially for CISOs. The M&amp;A prospect may have a partially unprotected attack surface, thus increasing security risk coming in the form of a gap between the attack surface they can and do protect and the attack surface (and accompanying assets) they need to defend. This gap is what many M&amp;A prospects bring to the table. And while an M&amp;A may have undisputed business and strategic value, CISOs must still address the security risks involved in acquiring another organization&#x27;s assets and its current attack surface, fully protected or not.</span>

                    <span>Fresh is in the ‚ÄúSSR with client-side progressive enhancement‚Äù camp. I have to admit their list of ‚Äòstand out‚Äô features are quite appealing:
No JS is shipped to the client by default
No build step
No configuration required
TypeScript support out of the box
If you‚Äôre feeling some JavaScript and/or Framework Fatigue, this won‚Äôt help. But competition pushes everyone (Next, Remix, etc) to improve. So, whether you check Fresh out or not, hopefully it‚Äôll have a positive impact on your work.

                    <span>This week Jesse Grosjean joins us to talk about his career as a solo indie Mac dev. Since 2004 Jesse has been building Mac apps under the company name Hog Bay Software producing hits such as WriteRoom, Taskpaper, and now Bike. We talk through the evolution of his apps, how he considers new features and improvements, why he chose and continues to choose the Mac platform, his business model and pricing for his apps, and what it takes to build his business around macOS and the driving force of the App Store.

We asked SQLite creator Richard Hipp about his database‚Äôs gap in penetration back when we first told the story of SQLite‚Äôs success in 2016:
Now for a website where you‚Äôve got a lot of write concurrency, you need to move to a client-server database engine because you need that server process there to coordinate the concurrency‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs just no way to do that in a serverless database like SQLite.

                    <span>Nolan Lawson:
Anyone who‚Äôs worked in the tech industry for long enough, especially at larger organizations, has seen it before. A legacy system exists: it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs complex, and no one fully understands how it works. Architects are brought in to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the system. They might wheel out a big whiteboard showing a lot of boxes and arrows pointing at other boxes, and inevitably, their solution is‚Ä¶ to add more boxes and arrows. Nobody can subtract from the system; everyone just adds.
Nolan posits the center cannot hold and the current market shift from bull to bear might help bring the collapse of complex software. But it‚Äôs never that simple, is it?
One thing working in complexity‚Äôs favor, though, is that engineers like complexity. Admit it: as much as we complain about other people‚Äôs complexity, we love our own. We love sitting around and dreaming up new architectural diagrams that can comfortably sit inside our own heads ‚Äì it‚Äôs only when these diagrams leave our heads, take shape in the real world, and outgrow the size of any one person‚Äôs head that the problems begin.

                    <span>At Google we use technologies like machine learning (ML) to build more useful products ‚Äî from filtering out email spam, to keeping maps up to date, to offering more relevant search results. Chrome is no exception: We use ML to make web images more accessible to people who are blind or have low vision, and we also generate real-time captions for online videos, in service of people in noisy environments, and those who are hard of hearing.
This work in Chrome continues, so we wanted to share some recent and future ML improvements that offer a safer, more accessible and more personalized browsing experience. Importantly: these updates are powered by on-device ML models, which means your data stays private, and never leaves your device.

Generative art is a creative process. While recent advances of DALL¬∑E unleash people‚Äôs creativity, having a single-prompt-single-output UX/UI locks the imagination to a single possibility, which is bad no matter how fine this single result is. DALL¬∑E Flow is an alternative to the one-liner, by formalizing the generative art as an iterative procedure.

                    <span>GitHub will archive all projects under the Atom org on December 15, 2022. Why?
Atom has not had significant feature development for the past several years, though we‚Äôve conducted maintenance and security updates during this period to ensure we‚Äôre being good stewards of the project and product. As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we‚Äôve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.
Atom was co-founder and long-time CEO Chris Wanstrath‚Äôs baby. We first heard its story from project lead Nathan Sobo on The Changelog back in 2017. Here‚Äôs what he had to say about the end of Atom‚Äôs era:
As Atom‚Äôs sun sets, Zed‚Äôs sun is rising. We‚Äôre not done here.

                    <span>Injection vulnerabilities result from insecure handling of user inputs. They are relatively simple to fix once the underlying issues that cause them are understood, and are frequently found by experienced reviewers who know what to look for. The prevalence of injection vulnerabilities today is one of the best arguments for continuing to perform code review in many organizations‚Äîthis type of vulnerability is most frequently caught through human inspection of the offending code.</span>

                    <span>Today we are talking with Maikel Vlasman, technical lead for a large Dutch machine construction company, and a cloud engineer by heart. We cover self-updating GitLab &amp; ArgoCD, Maikel‚Äôs thinking behind dev environment setup and a Kubernetes workshop that he is preparing for his team. The goal is to function as a true DevOps team with shared responsibilities.
This conversation started as a thread in our community Slack - link in the show notes. Thank you Maikel for being a long-time Changelog listener and for reaching out to us - we enjoyed telling this story.

We were just discussing this with Swyx on JS Party. What an unexpected turn of events!

                    <span>Lars Wikman on the history of ID3 tags:
If you were a Winamp user back in the day, or curate an MP3 collection currently, you might recognize the humble ID3 tag. It is what the metadata in the MP3 file is made up of. First it was pretty limited in the version later dubbed ID3v1. Like any good 2.0 they added a ton more fields, features, removed character limits and it was suddenly ID3v2. The latest spec is ID3v2.4 while the most commonly adopted one seems to be ID3v2.3. I recently found myself having a reason to dig into this specification.
I wonder what reason he might have to dig into this spec? Could it be for a soon-to-be-announced collab with his friends at Changelog? üòè
This post is not about the technical intricacies of the format‚Ä¶ This is about a simpler time, where people saw the wild possibilities of music on computers and when people cared about files, damnit. This is about some of the most interesting and entertaining things I‚Äôve run across while reading the spec.

                    <span>One of the smaller (but big for webdevs) announcements from yesterday‚Äôs WWDC keynote was Web Push coming to Safari. It‚Äôs built on three web standards all working together. What does it do, well it enables websites to ‚Äúnotify their users of time-sensitive or high-priority events, even if the user does not currently have the site open.‚Äù
As long as you‚Äôve coded your web application to the standards you will be able to reach Safari 16 users on macOS Ventura. You don‚Äôt need to join the Apple Developer Program to send Web Push notifications.
That‚Äôs good news, but is this feature something users want? I can think of zero websites that I‚Äôve allowed to send me notifications even when Safari is open, let alone when I‚Äôm not even browsing the web.
Jen Simmons posted a nice thread on Twitter alongside the announcement and fielded many people‚Äôs questions/concerns along the way.

                    <span>Christopher Meiklejohn has been working for two years on developing an automated resilience testing tool called Filibuster and was able to test it out at DoorDash during his research internship:
Access to DoorDash‚Äôs real-world industrial microservice application was extremely valuable both to ensure that Filibuster‚Äôs design matches how microservice applications are developed today and to influence future features that I would not have identified in a lab setting.
The results were pretty good! Maybe we won‚Äôt need chaos monkeys as tools like Filibuster advance?
In short, Filibuster can identify many of the technical resilience issues that exist in applications earlier, at the time of development, without testing in production as required in more traditional chaos engineering techniques.

In this article, we undertake a high-level analysis on some of those differences, and examine some do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt‚Äôs for designing developer tool interfaces.

                    <span>Built using second-generation 5-nanometer technology, M2 takes the industry-leading performance per watt of M1 even further with an 18 percent faster CPU, a 35 percent more powerful GPU, and a 40 percent faster Neural Engine.1 It also delivers 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to M1, and up to 24GB of fast unified memory.
I pity the fool who upgraded last Fall and can think of zero good reasons to spend another pile of cash at the Apple Store right now no matter how hard he tries to drum up literally any valid reason why that would be a wise decision but if he could think of one he totally would do it and now maybe he‚Äôs just waiting for someone else to come up with some sort of justification for doing exactly that.

                    <span>Victor Engmark thinks we should start test names with ‚Äúshould‚Äù for a handful of reasons, here‚Äôs a few:
It removes redundancy, because the function name should already be in the call stack.
It is falsifiable, a person reviewing the test can decide to which degree the name agrees with the actual test.
It encourages testing one property of the function per test
I don‚Äôt disagree, but I like to take it a step further: Let the ‚Äúshould‚Äù be implied by the rest of the test name.
Instead of: should replace children when updating instance
I prefer: replaces children when updating instances
Instead of: should apply discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
I prefer: applies discount when total cost exceeds 100 dollars
Most of Victor‚Äôs reasons for using ‚Äúshould‚Äù still apply with this format, but it‚Äôs less verbose and more accurately describes the software working as expected when the tests pass.

                    <span>I entered Rust four years ago. To this moment, I co-authored teloxide and dptree, wrote several publications and translated a number of language release announcements. I also managed to write some production code in Rust, and had a chance to speak at one online meetup dedicated to Rust. Still, from time to time I find myself disputing with Rust‚Äôs borrow checker and type system for no practical reason. Yes, I am no longer stupefied by such errors as cannot return reference to temporary value ‚Äì over time, I developed multiple heuristic strategies to cope with lifetimes‚Ä¶
But one recent situation has made me to fail ignominiously.

                    <span>Posted by Harshvardhan Sharma, Information Security Engineer, Google¬†

2021 was another record-breaking year for our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP). We paid a total of $8.7 million in rewards, our highest amount yet. 2021 saw some amazing work from the security research community. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the reports we received were for findings in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. It is heartening to see an increasing number of talented researchers getting involved in cloud security.
We first announced the GCP VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of GCP, in turn helping us make GCP more secure for our users, customers, and the internet at large. Even 3 years into the program, the submissions we are getting never cea‚Ä¶</span>

Return values from different expressions in a with block can only be distinguished by the shape of the data returned. This creates ambiguity in with‚Äôs else clauses that make code harder to understand and more challenging to modify correctly.
The author describes the problem in detail and even provides two alternatives to with..else that avoid the resulting ambiguity.

Every now and again I come across some discussion on making Emacs ‚Äúmodern‚Äù.1 The argument always go more or less like this - Emacs doesn‚Äôt look and behave like  and the world will end if we don‚Äôt copy something ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù from it‚Ä¶
If you ask me - there‚Äôs pretty much nothing we can do that would suddenly make Emacs as popular as VS Code. But you know what - that‚Äôs perfectly fine. After all there are plenty of ‚Äúmodern‚Äù editors that are even less popular than Emacs, so clearly being ‚Äúmodern‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make you popular. And there‚Äôs also our ‚Äúarch-nemesis‚Äù vim, that‚Äôs supposedly as ‚Äúdated‚Äù as Emacs, but is extremely popular.

                    <span>Accessing a major critical infrastructure network is very appealing to cybercriminals, as they can maximize societal impact and demand large ransom sums to fix tampered systems. With recent high-profile attacks, including that against the Colonial Pipeline in March 2021, it has become clear that the organizations handling critical infrastructure networks are now in the firing line. Critical infrastructure is vulnerable to both threat groups that are evolving their tactics and public scrutiny if they do not remain transparent when an attack occurs.</span>

                    <span>When we had Paul Copplestone from Supabase on The Changelog I asked him what a cloud native Postgres would look like. He replied,
Decoupled compute and storage. So the idea is that you should be able to attach the compute part of it to a storage, hopefully like an infinite storage; you know, anything that is infinitely scalable. If you can do this, and in particular, if the compute can start up very fast, maybe in, say, a hundred milliseconds via some sort of HTTP response, then that‚Äôs cloud native, yeah.
Enter Neon, which sells itself as:
The multi-cloud fully managed Postgres with a generous free tier. We separated storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage.
Behind this new business from MemSQL co-founder Nikita Shamgunov is the linked (Apache-licensed) server written in Rust.

                    <span>Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs a Pi-hole
How does the Pi Hole work though? The Pi Hole answers your computer‚Äôs DNS queries and if it is a domain on the blacklist, it sends the request to the Pi Web server.  This Web server just serves up a blank page.  So instead of loading the ad from the real domain, the blank page from the Pi is downloaded, thus ‚Äúblocking‚Äù the ad or metric.
How effective is the setup, in practice?
Statistically speaking our household is averaging 15% of queries blocked and a spike over a bad weather weekend of 30% blocked. It is scary and incredible to think the number of ads and metrics forced upon us, and this number continues to increase. I am delighted with the Pi Hole project and am recommending it to all.

Graphite is an open-source CLI and code review dashboard built for engineers who want to write and review smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster. We cover all the details ‚Äì how they got started, how this product emerged from another idea they were working on, the state of adoption, why stacking changes is the way of the future, how it‚Äôs just Git under the hood, and what they‚Äôre doing with the $20M in funding they just got from a16z.

                    <span>Last week I logged the very impressive Imagen project, which smarter people than me have said is the SOTA for text-to-image synthesis. Now a WIP implementation is just a pip install imagen-pytorch away.
Architecturally, it is actually much simpler than DALL-E2. It consists of a cascading DDPM conditioned on text embeddings from a large pretrained T5 model (attention network). It also contains dynamic clipping for improved classifier free guidance, noise level conditioning, and a memory efficient unet design.

DuckDuckGo, the privacy centric search firm have been found to be allowing Microsoft trackers through their browser. It‚Äôs dishonest, and I‚Äôm really disappointed.
Noteworthy: this is the DDG browser, which I‚Äôve never used. Not the search engine. But still, this is concerning like Kev says:
DuckDuckGo tout themselves as being highly transparent and privacy respecting in everything they do. So to discover that they have been keeping this tidbit of information from their users ‚Äî one that goes against the very fibre of the company ‚Äî is a little concerning for me.
