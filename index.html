In recognition of World Password Day 2023, Google announced its next step toward a passwordless future: passkeys. 



Passkeys are a new, passwordless authentication method that offer a convenient authentication experience for sites and apps, using just a fingerprint, face scan or other screen lock. They are designed to enhance online security for users. Because they are based on the public key cryptographic protocols that underpin security keys, they are resistant to phishing and other online attacks, making them more secure than SMS, app based one-time passwords and other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA). And since passkeys are standardized, a single…</span>

Today, we are announcing the General Availability 1.0 version of rules_oci, an open-sourced Bazel plugin (“ruleset”) that makes it simpler and more secure to build container images with Bazel. This effort was a collaboration we had with Aspect and the Rules Authors Special Interest Group. In this post, we’ll explain how rules_oci differs from its predecessor, rules_docker, and describe the benefits it offers for both container image security and the container community.

                    <span>José Valim joins Jerod to talk all about what’s new in Livebook – the Elixir-based interactive code notebook he’s been working on the last few years.
José made a big bet when he decided to bring machine learning to Elixir. That bet is now paying off with amazing new capabilities such as building and deploying a Whisper-based chat app to Hugging Face in just 15 minutes.
José demoed that and much more during Livebook’s first-ever launch week. Let’s get into it.

Starting today, you can create and use passkeys on your personal Google Account. When you do, Google will not ask for your password or 2-Step Verification (2SV) when you sign in.





Passkeys are a more convenient and safer alternative to passwords. They work on all major platforms and browsers, and allow users to sign in by unlocking their computer or mobile device with their fingerprint, face recognition or a local PIN.





Using passwords puts a lot of responsibility on users. Choosing strong passwords and remembering them across various accounts can be hard. In addition, even the most savvy users are often misled into giving them up during phishing attempts. 2SV (2FA/MFA) he…</span>

                    <span>Model sizes are crazy these days with billions and billions of parameters. As Mark Kurtz explains in this episode, this makes inference slow and expensive despite the fact that up to 90%+ of the parameters don’t influence the outputs at all.
Mark helps us understand all of the practicalities and progress that is being made in model optimization and CPU inference, including the increasing opportunities to run LLMs and other Generative AI models on commodity hardware.

Code at Scale
At Google, tens of thousands of software engineers contribute to a multi-billion-line mono-repository. This repository, stored in a system called Piper, contains the source code of shared libraries, production services, experimental programs, diagnostic and debugging tools: basically anything that&#x27;s code-related.

This open approach can be very powerful. For example, if an engineer is unsure how to use a library, they can find examples just by searching. It also allows kind-hearted individuals to perform important updates across the whole repository, be that migrating to newer APIs, or following language developments such as Python 3, or Go generics.

Code, however, doesn&#x27;t come for free: it&#x27;s expensive to produce, but also costs real engineering time to mainta…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Rae Wang, Director of Product Management (Android Security and Privacy Team) 


Unlike other mobile OSes, Android is built with a transparent, open-source architecture. We firmly believe that our users and the mobile ecosystem at-large should be able to verify Android’s security and safety and not just take our word for it. 
The Assurance of Android Protected Confirmation
announced they’re working with Google on a pilot project to establish Protected Confirmation as a common application programmable interface standard. In a pilot planned for 2023, UBS online banking customers with Pixel 6 or 7 devices can use Android Protected Confirmation backed by StrongBox, a certified hardware vault with physical attack protections, to confirm payments and verify online purchases through a hardware-based confirmation in their UBS Access App. 


Demonstrating Real-World Use for Android Protection Confirmation


We’ve been working closely with UBS to bring this pilot to life and ensure they’re able to test it on Google Pixel devices. Demonstrating real-world use cases that are enabled by Android Protected Confirmation unlocks the promise of this technology by delivering improved and innovative experiences for our users. We’re seeing interest in Android Protected Confirmation across the industry and OEMs are increasingly looking at how to build even more hardware-based confirmation into critical security user moments. We look forward to forming an industry alliance that will work together to strengthen mobile security and home in on protecting confirmation support.</span>

Keeping Google Play safe for users and developers remains a top priority for Google. Google Play Protect continues to scan billions of installed apps each day across billions of Android devices to keep users safe from threats like malware and unwanted software. 


In 2022, we prevented 1.43 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play in part due to new and improved security features and policy enhancements — in combination with our continuous investments in machine learning systems and app review processes. We also continued to combat malicious developers and fraud rings, banning 173K bad accounts, and preventing over $2 billion in fraudulent and …</span>

Last week the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) announced the release of SLSA v1.0, a framework that helps secure the software supply chain. Ten years of using an internal version of SLSA at Google has shown that it’s crucial to warding off tampering and keeping software secure. It’s especially gratifying to see SLSA reaching v1.0 as an open source project—contributors have come together to produce solutions that will benefit everyone.

However, with so many advancements happening at once, it can be overwhelming to keep up with all the latest developments. To help us navigate through this complex terrain, we’ve invited Raj - one of the most adept at explaining State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI in practical terms - to join us on the podcast.
Raj discusses several intriguing topics such as in-context learning, reasoning, LLM options, and related tooling. But that’s not all! We also hear from Raj about the rapidly growing data science and AI community on TikTok.

                    <span>The panel dives into a topic that makes most software developers cringe: Professional networking. Starting with a definition - what does it even mean? - they go into hacks they’ve found for getting more comfortable with networking, building your network in person or online, and then using your network to find new job opportunities or consulting work.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Cory Doctorow (this episode contains explicit language) about his newest book Chokepoint Capitalism, which he co-autored with Rebecca Giblin. Chokepoint Capitalism is about how big tech and big content have captured creative labor markets and the ways we can win them back. We talk about chokepoints creating chickenized reverse-centaurs, paying for your robot boss (think Uber, Doordash, Amazon Drivers), the chickenization that’s climbing the priviledge gradient from the most blue collar workers to the middle-class. There are chokepoints in open source, AI generative art, interoperability, music, film, and media. To quote Cory, “We’re all fighting the same fight.”

High profile open source vulnerabilities have made it clear that securing the supply chains underpinning modern software is an urgent, yet enormous, undertaking. As supply chains get more complicated, enterprise developers need to manage the tidal wave of vulnerabilities that propagate up through dependency trees. Open source maintainers need streamlined ways to vet proposed dependencies and protect their projects. A rise in attacks coupled with increasingly complex supply chains means that supply chain security problems need solutions on the ecosystem level. 


One way developers can manage this enormous risk is by choosing a more secure language. As part of Google’s commitment to advancing…</span>
