                    <span>Event-driven systems may not be the go-to solution for everyone because of the challenges they can add. While the system reacting to events published in other parts of the system seem elegant, some of the complexities they bring can be challenging.  However, they do offer durability, autonomy &amp; flexibility.
In this episode, we’ll define event-driven architecture, discuss the problems it solves, challenges it poses &amp; potential solutions.

                    <span>According to Solana Larsen: “Too often, it feels like we have lost control of the internet to the interests of Big Tech, Big Data — and now Big AI.” In the latest season of Mozilla’s IRL podcast (edited by Solana), a number of stories are featured to highlight the trailblazers who are reclaiming power over AI to put people first. We discuss some of those stories along with the issues that they surface.

                    <span>This week we’re talking with Cory Doctorow (this episode contains explicit language) about how we can get back to that “new good internet.” Cory’s new book The Internet Con offers a lens to this conversation about disenshittifying the internet through anti-trust laws, limits on corporate tweaking, regulating unconstrained capitalism, and all the ways enshittification is enabled. Cory also shares his experience recording his own audio book under the direction of Gabrielle de Cuir at Skyboat Media, and what’s to come from his next Science Fiction book The Lost Cause.

                    <span>On Monday, October 30, 2023, the U.S. White House issued its Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.  Two days later, a policy paper was issued by the U.K. government entitled The Bletchley Declaration by Countries Attending the AI Safety Summit, 1-2 November 2023.  It was signed by 29 countries, including the United States and China, the global leaders in AI research.
In this Fully Connected episode, Daniel and Chris parse the details and highlight key takeaways from these documents, especially the extensive and detailed executive order, which has the force of law in the United States.

Since 2018, Google has partnered with ARM and collaborated with many ecosystem partners (SoCs vendors, mobile phone OEMs, etc.) to develop Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) technology. We are now happy to share the growing adoption in the ecosystem. MTE is now available on some OEM devices (as noted in a recent blog post by Project Zero) with Android 14 as a developer option, enabling developers to use MTE to discover memory safety issues in their application easily. 
The biggest contributor to security vulnerabilities are memory safety related defects and Google has invested in a set of technologies to help mitigate memory safety risks. These include but are not limited to:

Do you ever read code and find it hard to understand? You may be experiencing cognitive load!
Cognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort required to complete a task. When reading code, you have to keep in mind information such as values of variables, conditional logic, loop indices, data structure state, and interface contracts. Cognitive load increases as code becomes more complex. People can typically hold up to 5–7 separate pieces of informat…</span>

Improving the interoperability of web services is an important and worthy goal. We believe that it should be easier for people to maintain and control their digital identities. And we appreciate that policymakers working on European Union digital certificate legislation, known as eIDAS, are working toward this goal. However, a specific part of the legislation, Article 45, hinders browsers’ ability to enforce certain security requirements on certificates, potentially holding back advances in web security for decades. We and many past and present leaders in the international web community have significant concerns about Article 45&#x27;s impact on security. 


We urge lawmakers to heed the calls of scientists and security experts to revise this part of the legislation rather than erode users’ privacy and security on the web.</span>

                    <span>Jean Yang’s research on programming languages at Carnegie Mellon led her to realize that APIs are the layer that makes or breaks quality software systems. Unfortunately, developers are underserved by tools for dealing with, securing &amp; understanding APIs.
That realization led her to found Akita Software, which led her to join Postman by way of acquisition. That move, at least in part, also led her to join us on this very podcast. We think you’re going to enjoy this interview, we sure did.

Keeping Google Play safe for users and developers remains a top priority for Google. As users increasingly prioritize their digital privacy and security, we continue to invest in our Data Safety section and transparency labeling efforts to help users make more informed choices about the apps they use. 


Research shows that transparent security labeling plays a crucial role in consumer risk perception, building trust, and influencing product purchasing decisions. We believe the same principles apply for labeling and badging in the Google Play store. The transparency of an app’s data security and privacy play a key role in a user’s decision to download, trust, and use an app.

Tuhin’s company Baseten specializes in model deployment and monitoring at any scale, and it was a privilege to talk with him about the trends he is seeing in both tooling and usage of open access models. We were able to touch on the common use cases for integrating self-hosted models and how the boom in generative AI has influenced that ecosystem.

New AI innovations and applications are reaching consumers and businesses on an almost-daily basis. Building AI securely is a paramount concern, and we believe that Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) can help chart a path for creating AI applications that users can trust. Today, we’re highlighting two new ways to make information about AI supply chain security universally discoverable and verifiable, so that AI can be created and used responsibly. 





The first principle of SAIF is to ensure that the AI ecosystem has strong security foundations. In particular, the software supply chains for components specific to AI development, such as machine learning models, need to be secured against threats i…</span>

In September, we shared how we are implementing the voluntary AI commitments that we and others in industry made at the White House in July. One of the most important developments involves expanding our existing Bug Hunter Program to foster third-party discovery and reporting of issues and vulnerabilities specific to our AI systems. Today, we’re publishing more details on these new reward program elements for the first time. Last year we issued over $12 million in rewards to security researchers who tested our products for vulnerabilities, and we expect today’s announcement to fuel even greater collaboration for years to come.

When adding loops and conditionals, even simple code can become difficult to understand.
Consider this change:




if (commode.HasPreferredCustomer()) {

if (commode.HasPreferredCustomer()) {


  commode.WarmSeat();

  commode.WarmSeat();



} else if (commode.CustomerOnPhone()) {



  commode.ChillSeat();


}

}




While the above change may seem simple, even adding a single else statement can make the code harder to follow since the complexity of code grow…</span>

                    <span>It seems like everyone is interested in Rust these days. Even the most popular Python linter, Ruff, isn’t written in Python! It’s written in Rust. But what is the state of training or inferencing deep learning models in Rust? In this episode, we are joined by Nathaniel Simard, the creator burn. We discuss Rust in general, the need to have support for AI in multiple languages, and the current state of doing “AI things” in Rust.

                    <span>Listen to our Next Level album as a podcast! We grew up in the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis. It’s no surprise that so many of our tracks are inspired by the 8-bit and 16-bit music of our youth. From Castlevania to Contra, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many more — we were inspired by all the nostalgic soundtracks from the games that got us here, to give our pods one-of-a-kind vibes. If you’ve been head nodding to our beats during our shows and you’ve been wishing for a way to listen outside of our pods, then this release will be an absolute delight.
It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this on your next coding adventure or deep work session…

                    <span>It’s not that uncommon to have the mysterious Breakmaster Cylinder produce your podcast’s theme song. But it’s super uncommon to collaborate with BMC over the course of 7 years to produce fresh, custom beats for your entire podcast portfolio.
Theme songs, outros, ad music, ins, outs, stabs, robot noises, jingles… you name it and BMC has produced it for us. All with that signature glitchy goodness that BMC is known for. Eventually, we ended up with a deep catalog of tracks that only live on our podcasts or on our hard drives. Not anymore, baby!
We’re excited to announce the release of TWO full-length musical albums!

Mobile devices have supercharged our modern lives, helping us do everything from purchasing goods in store and paying bills online to storing financial data, health records, passwords and pictures. According to Data.ai, the pandemic accelerated existing mobile habits – with app categories like finance growing 25% year-over-year and users spending over 100 billion hours in shopping apps. It&#x27;s now even more important that data is protected so that bad actors can&#x27;t access the information.
