                    <span>We’re back! This is from our “lost episodes” — This is your brain…and this is your brain on burnout, any questions? OK, but seriously, burnout effects everyone, even if they/you don’t admit it. Burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress. It can affect ANYONE, but it is especially common among high-performers who push themselves to the limit. In this episode, we dive into the latest research on burnout and its effects on the brain, as well as offer practical advice for preventing and managing burnout. If you’re heading into 2023 feeling overwhelmed and drained, this episode is for you.

Between his writings on L-Space Diaries and his AI notes repo on GitHub, we had a lot to cover around the world of AI and what might be coming in 2023.
Also, we have one more show coming out before the end of the year — our 5th annual “State of the log” episode where Adam and Jerod look back at the year and talk through their favorite episodes of the year and feature voices from the community. So, stay tuned for that next week.

                    <span>On Wednesday, Stability AI announced it would allow artists to remove their work from the training dataset for an upcoming Stable Diffusion 3.0 release. The move comes as an artist advocacy group called Spawning tweeted that Stability AI would honor opt-out requests collected on its Have I Been Trained website. The details of how the plan will be implemented remain incomplete and unclear, however.
This seems like a step in the right direction, but it appears that artists will have to proactively register and manually flag matched images in the database. Ain’t nobody got time for that!

                    <span>Python’s magic methods - also known as dunder (double underscore) methods - can be used to implement a lot of cool things. Most of the time we use them for simple stuff, such as constructors (__init__), string representation (__str__, __repr__) or arithmetic operators (__add__/__mul__). There are however many more magic methods which you probably haven’t heard about and in this article we will explore all of them (even the hidden and undocumented).

                    <span>sqlite-loadable-rs is a new framework for writing fast, performant, and mostly-safe SQLite extensions in Rust. These extensions are nearly as fast those written in C, with the added benefit of Rust’s memory safety features, easy access to thousands of 3rd party crates and packages on crates.io, all while maintaining a splendid developer experience.

The idea was some serverless, some EKS, and many incremental improvements.
So how did all of this work out in practice? How did the improved system cope with the Black Friday peak, as well as all the following Christmas orders? Thank you Alex for sharing with us your Ship It! inspired Kaizen story. It’s a wonderful Christmas present! 🎄🎁

Earlier this year, the App Defense Alliance expanded to include new initiatives outside of malware detection and is now the home for several industry-led collaborations including Malware Mitigation, MASA (Mobile App Security Assessment) &amp; CASA (Cloud App Security Assessment).

                    <span>Tony Parker writing on Swift’s blog:
When Swift began life as an open source project, we wanted to open not just the language itself, but the ecosystem around it. Foundation has been instrumental in the success of decades of software and has been an integral part of the Swift developer experience from the beginning, and we knew it had to be included in the open source offering.
Historically, Apple’s open source efforts have varied in just how open they are when it comes to community. On that topic, this is an uplifting bit of prose:
Open source projects are at their best when the community of users can participate and become a community of developers. A new, open contribution process will be available to enable all developers to contribute new API to Foundation.
This new Foundation project is slated to launch on GitHub in 2023.

there should be a bunch of different:
publishing services, like Substack and Ghost
reading apps, like Gmail and Matter
community platforms, like Slack and Discord
and we should look for ways to make these reading, publishing, and community services all play nicely together. I’m calling this model “the unbundled web,” and I think RSS should be the primary method of interop.

Docked Rails attempts to flatten the onboarding curve by only requiring a working Docker installation in order to get started making a new Rails application, working with that application during development, and running a basic server. All based on pre-configured commands and dependencies living in a Docker image.
Getting started is as easy as:
docker volume create ruby-bundle-cache
alias rails&#x3D;&#x27;docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/rails -v ruby-bundle-cache:/bundle dhh37/rails&#x27;

Today, we’re launching the OSV-Scanner, a free tool that gives open source developers easy access to vulnerability information relevant to their project. 
Last year, we undertook an effort to improve vulnerability triage for developers and consumers of open source software. This involved publishing the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) schema and launching the OSV.dev service, the first distributed open source vulnerability database. OSV allows all the different open source ecosystems and vulnerability databases to publish and consume information  in one simple, precise, and machine readable format. 
The OSV-Scanner is the next step in this effort, providing an officially supported frontend to the OSV database that connec…</span>

                    <span>I thouroughly enjoyed reading this. It’s interesting to think about the evolution of transport storage. To this day, the USB thumb drive has proved to be the long-term winner and something I personally use very often. Wanna install Debian or do a clean install of macOS? You’ll likely do it by creating a bootable USB thumb drive.
Before the invention of the thumb drive, computer users stored and transported their files using floppy disks. Developed by IBM in the 1960s, first 8-inch and later 5 ¼-inch and 3 ½-inch floppy disks replaced cassette tapes as the most practical portable storage media. Floppy disks were limited by their relatively small storage capacity—even double-sided, double-density disks could store only 1.44 MB of data. During the 1990s, as the size of files and software increased…
Would you be surprised to learn that the supposed inventor of the thumb drive is in jail right now in Singapore? But why?

                    <span>SQLite has few functions compared to other database management systems. SQLite authors see this as a feature rather than a problem, because SQLite has an extension mechanism in place.
There are a lot of SQLite extensions out there, but they are incomplete, inconsistent and scattered across the internet. sqlean brings them together, neatly packaged into domain modules, documented, tested, and built for Linux, Windows and macOS.
Think of it like an extended standard library for SQLite.

                    <span>Stephan Schmidt warns: “We have invited complexity through the door. But it will not leave as easily.”
One way to simplify your stack and reduce the moving parts, speed up development, lower the risk and deliver more features in your startup is “Use Postgres for everything”. Postgres can replace - up to millions of users - many backend technologies, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Mongo and Redis among them.
He then goes on to list nine things you can use Postgres for that replace more specific solutions: fulltext search, geospatial queries, etc.

When it comes to API usability, Ruby is so tough to beat. This looks actually fun to use!

                    <span>How will large language models (LLMs) change the world?
No one knows. With such uncertainty, a good exercise is to look for historical analogies—to think about other technologies and ask what would happen if LLMs played out the same way.
I like to keep things concrete, so I’ll discuss the impact of LLMs on writing. But most of this would also apply to the impact of LLMs on other fields, as well as other AI technologies like AI art/music/video/code.
What follows are 13 examples of technological innovations that changed the world and description of how they affected they way people work. Here’s an example analogy of Feet and Segways:
First, there was walking. Then the Segway came to CHANGE THE NATURE OF HUMAN TRANSPORT. Twenty years later, there is still walking, plus occasionally low-key alternatives like electric scooters.
In this analogy, LLMs work fine but just aren’t worth the trouble in most cases and society doesn’t evolve to integrate them. Domain-specific LLMs are used for some applications, but we start to associate “general” LLMs with tourists and mall cops. George W. Bush falls off an LLM on vacation and everyone loses their minds.

We care deeply about privacy. We also know that trust is built by transparency. This blog, and the technical paper reference within, is an example of that commitment: we describe an important new Android privacy infrastructure called Private Compute Core (PCC). 
Some of our most exciting machine learning features use continuous sensing data — information from the microphone, camera, and screen. These features keep you safe, help you communicate, and facilitate stronger connections with people you care about. To unlock this new generation of innovative concepts, we built a specialized sandbox to privately process and protect this data.

This blog post details an exploit for CVE-2022-42703 (P0 issue 2351 - Fixed 5 September 2022), a bug Jann Horn found in the Linux kernel&#x27;s memory management (MM) subsystem that leads to a use-after-free on struct anon_vma. As the bug is very complex (I certainly struggle to understand it!), a future blog post will describe the bug in full. For the time being, the issue tracker entry, this LWN article explaining what an anon_vma is and the commit that introduced the bug are great resources in order to gain additional context.

Successfully triggering the underlying vulnerability causes folio-&gt;mapping to point to a freed anon_vma object. Calling madvise(..., MADV_PAGEOUT)can then be used to repeatedly trigger accesses to the freed anon_vma in foli…</span>

                    <span>OpenAI recently released a model for automatic speech recognition called Whisper. I decided to reimplement the inference of the model from scratch using C/C++. To achieve this I implemented a minimalistic tensor library in C and ported the high-level architecture of the model in C++. The entire code is less than 8000 lines of code and is contained in just 2 source files without any third-party dependencies.
State of the art voice recognition without any PyTorch baggage and it’s optimized to run on Apple Silicon!

This seems like a good enough solution to yet another battle between security and usability.

The preso is average, but the Q&amp;A near the end is above average, if you ask me. OH! And also we got Zoom bombed twice, which was a first for me. Thankfully, it was also a last. So far, at least…

                    <span>Simon Willison is using this year’s Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn Rust.
He’s using Copilot to help him with syntax/snippets via comment-driven prompting. He’s using ChatGPT as a study partner by asking it questions about how to do things in Rust. Is it working?
So far I think this is working really well.
I feel like I’m beginning to get a good mental model of how Rust works, and a lot of the basic syntax is beginning to embed itself into my muscle memory.
The real test is going to be if I can first make it to day 25 (with no prior Advent of Code experience I don’t know how much the increasing difficulty level will interfere with my learning) and then if I can actually write a useful Rust program after that without any assistance from these AI models.
And honestly, the other big benefit here is that this is simply a lot of fun. I’m finding interacting with AIs in this way—as an actual exercise, not just to try them out—is deeply satisfying and intellectually stimulating.
This might be an early glimpse into the future of AI-assisted learning…
