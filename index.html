                    <span>Not much has been written yet on how Go’s fuzzing system actually works, so I’ll talk a bit about that here. If you’d like to try it out, Getting started with fuzzing is a great tutorial.
Jay Conrod worked on Go 1.18’s fuzzing feature, so there’s very few people who could write a post as detailed and accurate as this. He also discussed fuzzing in detail with us on Go Time #187.

                    <span>Regular expressions aren’t easy to write, but they’re especially hard to read. This project is yet another attempt to make them more readable and maintainable. The aim is to create a new language that compiles to regexen so we don’t have to write them directly.

As is customary around these parts, we aren’t going to write much code. Just glue it together. First up, we’ll need a handful of dependencies.
Plug, Cowboy, and extty do all the heavy lifting.

Today Laurence is a developer advocate at Google focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). “It’s my goal to inform and inspire the world about what we can do with AI and ML, and help developers realize these possibilities.” Laurence applied at Google in 2013 after hearing then-CEO Larry Page talk about Google’s vision to make the world a better place. “I was hired on my third attempt — so yes, I failed twice!”

: Hi Jeremy - we have a  ticket - escalated to , , etc. 
 is on trying to advise as well. Are you available this evening if needed for diagnostics?  is on the call now
No obligation; just checking in to see what my availability is. Quickly thinking it over – I didn’t have any plans tonight, nothing in particular on my agenda. Why not? If I can help then someone else on the team won’t have to, and I don’t have anything better to do tonight.
The game is afoot. It might be a long night…

                    <span>As developers, we use TypeScript for a few different reasons. The self-documentation aspects are huge – being able to step into an unfamiliar function and know the shape of the objects it’s expecting is a massive boon when working on a large project. The added tooling features, with IntelliSense and its ilk, are also a big help for productivity. But to me, the most important reason to use a strongly typed system is to eliminate an entire class of runtime bugs, where a function gets passed an object it doesn’t know how to handle and fails at runtime.
It’s that last reason that leads to the purpose for this post. I recently handled a bug where a React component was throwing an exception at runtime. The source of the issue was a recent refactor done when internationalizing this area of our ap…</span>

This is the most significant improvement to our app’s architecture in years, and now we have unlocked the next level: multi-cloud. We talk about that at length, and how it fits in our 2022 setup. The TL;DR is that changelog.com will fly, both literally and figuratively.
We also address Steve’s comment that he left on our previous Kaizen episode - thanks Steve!
Towards the end, we talk about Gerhard’s new beginnings at Dagger, where he gets to work with a world-class team and build the next-gen CI/CD. That’s right, Gerhard is now walking the Ship It talk all day, every day. If you want to watch him code live, you can do so every Thursday, in our weekly community session.

                    <span>Steven Wittens takes us on a trip to a parallel universe where the React team made different decisions (with less legacy constraints). What might this universe look like? For starters:
No-hooks and Early Return
Component Morphing
useMemo vs useEffect + setState
and some wild Yeet-Reduce results

On this show we talk about the git flow she suggests and why, how this flow works for her when she’s hacking on the Render codebase (and when she uses it), the good and the bad of Git, and we also talked about the cognitive load of Git commits as you work.

                    <span>Rands asking himself some tough questions about our “new normal” remote work environments:
Relative to the Pandemic, the single biggest work question I’ve been asking myself for two years is: what did we lose? What is the measurable and objective loss for teams not working in close proximity? I’ve been looking for cracks. I’ve been looking for leading indicators of future doom. The Great Resignation seems like a proper crack, right? But are people quitting their jobs because they can’t work together or because their current job sucks and all this terror in the air has given them a new appreciation of what really matters?
A sobering perspective.

                    <span>Leonardo Losoviz is pretty excited that Matt Mullenweg expressed interest in having WordPress’s editor comply with the Block Protocol:
My excitement comes from what happened with GraphQL, where the release of servers, clients, and tools adhering to a common specification has produced a rich ecosystem; and from my own development of a plugin that could support new features through the protocol.
Don’t fret if you’re new to this “Block Protocol” concept, like myself: Leonardo starts off this (long) article with a nice explainer before he gets into the potential outcomes of WordPress’s involvement.

                    <span>Learn how sudo works by writing your own version in Python!
One might think that sudo is actually some binary deeply integrated into the kernel, relying on a special purpose-built system call to achieve its functionality. After all, it lets you use root without even providing the password for that account! But thanks to one bit inside file permissions, sudo can exist without any of this.

                    <span>A brief (6 minutes to read) history of MS-DOS:
First released on August 12, 1981, MS-DOS became the foundation for business computing for almost two decades. MS-DOS stood for Microsoft Disk Operating System and was often referred to simply as “DOS”. It is the software that helped build Microsoft, becoming the foundation Microsoft built the Windows operating system on. It went through 8 (and a half-ish) major revisions, with the final version being shipped with Windows ME in September, 2000.

                    <span>Posted by Eduardo Vela, Vulnerability Matchmaker 

Until December 31 2022 we will pay 20,000 to 91,337 USD for exploits of vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, GKE or kCTF that are exploitable on our test lab.
We launched an expansion of kCTF VRP on November 1, 2021 in which we paid 31,337 to 50,337 USD to those that are able to compromise our kCTF cluster and obtain a flag. We increased our rewards because we recognized that in order to attract the attention of the community we needed to match our rewards to their expectations. We consider the expansion to have been a success, and because of that we would like to extend it even further to at least until the end of the year (2022).
During the last three months, we received 9 submissions and paid over 175,000 USD so far. The sub…</span>

                    <span>This week Adam is joined by Joe Percoco — the Co-CEO of Titan, a premier investment manager for everyone. Titan is an investment company, a media, and a tech company, all rolled into one. Mid last year, they closed a $58 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) at a $450 million valuation. They currently have $750 million in assets managed and more than 35,000 clients.
Why should Titan exist? In Joe’s words, “Wall Street ignores everyday investors, and caters only to the ultra wealthy. This divide doesn’t sit well with us. So, we built Titan.” On today’s show Joe shares the journey, the why’s, the how’s, and the sequencing it might take to get to a $1 trillion of assets managed.

                    <span>This week we are talking to Robin Morero, the person behind fabled.se, a DevOps consultancy from Gothenburg, Sweden. Their motto is “move faster and prosper”, which Gerhard prefers to the initial “move fast and break things”.
Fabled works with startups primarily, and after 26 years, Robin has a few interesting insights to share. What do you think, are haunted codebases real? At what point do pull requests become harmful? What about k3s running on KVM as a simple starting point for production? If this reminds you of #7, and the follow-up YouTube stream with Lars, it’s no coincidence.

This was years ago by the way, long before COVID, when pretty much every interview was in-person. The shock factor of pulling out 2 pages of questions wouldn’t translate so well to Zoom, haha. But still: if time runs out, you can mention that you still have a bunch of questions, and could please email them afterward.

                    <span>PgBouncer is a popular connection pooler for Postgres. PgCat is that same functionality, only in Rust. This is alpha software and there is no worse place to run alpha software (IMHO) than in places that have direct connections to your database. Still, this is worth linking to because it’s yet another instance of open source infrastructure code getting Rusty.

                    <span>Posted by Sarah Jacobus, Vulnerability Rewards Team 


Last year was another record setter for our Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs). Throughout 2021, we partnered with the security researcher community to identify and fix thousands of  vulnerabilities – helping keep our users and the internet safe. 

Thanks to these incredible researchers, Vulnerability Reward Programs across Google continued to grow, and we are excited to report that in 2021 we awarded a record breaking $8,700,000 in vulnerability rewards – with researchers donating over $300,000 of their rewards to a charity of their choice. 

We also launched bughunters.google.com in 2021, a public researcher portal dedicated to keeping Google products and the internet safe and secure. This new platform brings all of our VRPs (Googl…</span>

                    <span>Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.
It has an S3-compatible API and can be used as a storage backend for things like NextCloud, Matrix, and Mastodon. It’s being built by a non-profit in France that is “working to promote self-hosting and small-scale hosting.” Why do they do this?
self-hosting means running our own hardware at home, and providing 24/7 Internet services from there. We have many reasons for doing this. One is because this is the only way we can truly control who has access to our data. Another one is that it helps us be aware of the physical substrate of which the Internet is made: making the Internet run has an environmental cost which we want to evaluate and keep under control. The physical hardware also gives us a sense of community, calling to mind all of the people that could currently be connected and making use of our services, and reminding us of the purpose for which we are doing this.

                    <span>As humans, we constantly learn from the world around us. We experience inputs that shape our knowledge — including the boundaries of both what we know and what we don’t know.
Many of today’s machines also learn by example. However, these machines are typically trained on datasets and information that doesn’t always include rare or out-of-the-ordinary examples that inevitably come up in real-life scenarios. What is an algorithm to do when faced with the unknown?
I recently spoke with Abhijit Guha Roy, an engineer on the Health AI team, and Ian Kivlichan, an engineer on the Jigsaw team, to hear more about using AI in real-world scenarios and better understand the importance of training it to know when it doesn’t know.
Abhijit, tell me about your recent research in the dermatology space.

                    <span>This major undertaking was discussed by Matt Ahrens on our recent ZFS episode. How it works:
The feature reflows existing data, essentially rewriting it onto a new arrangement of disks – meaning the original group plus a newly added disk. In so doing, a new adjacent chunk of free space is created at the end of the logical RAID-Z group and thus at the end of each physical disk.
With a disclaimer:
While all capabilities of this feature have been implemented and all tests so far have been passed, there are still a few loose ends to tie up. Specifically, there is some code cleanup to do, some verbose logging to remove, some code documentation to write, and similar relatively minor tasks. We aim for this to be integrated by Q3.

                    <span>Adrien Griveau makes the case for settings as a feature, not a design bug. He build the argument from a simple (and perhaps controversial) point: “users love settings”
There certainly are moments where I find myself on the settings page of a product because it failed to deliver the experience I really wanted. But not all settings are created equal.
There’s a difference between product settings that a product needs to get right by default and preferences that designers deliberately shouldn’t have a strong opinion on.

                    <span>Conor O’Neill:
I blame my life-long work obsession with automation and avoiding repetitive drudgery on my first boss and mentor Danny in S3. He was horrified to see me doing the same thing over and over in a VAX code editor and introduced me to the magical world of macros.
From that point onwards, I was a man on a mission to save us all as much time as possible in our working days.
From Yahoo! Pipes to IFTTT to Node-RED and beyond: this is quite the journey.

Loops are the standard way to process collections like arrays and lists. However, some loops implement the same patterns repeatedly, leading to duplicate code. Higher-order functions—functions that use other functions as inputs or outputs—can reduce duplication by providing a simpler way to express common operations with collections.


Consider these two loops in JavaScript that decide if every object in an array meets a condition:


 
  
    
let everyRequestValid &#x3D; true;
for (const request of requests) {
  if (!isValid(request)) {
  …</span>

Relocation to a foreign country for work can be very exciting and lead to unique opportunities that couldn’t be accessed in your home country. At the same time, it’s a real challenge - I know it firsthand… Hopefully, this handbook will give you the necessary guidance. Topics covered include resume preparation, job search, salary negotiation, relocation packages, and more.

                    <span>It’s still in closed beta, but this looks like a really cool environment for data scientists and other folks who code to accomplish other goals vs code as craft. One cool thing you can do is take your Jupyter notebooks and convert them to PyFlow graphs (and vice versa).

                    <span>This week we’re joined by Nora Jones, founder and CEO at Jeli where they help teams gain insight and learnings from incidents. Back in December Nora shared here thoughts in a Changelog post titled “Incident” shouldn’t be a four-letter word - which got a lot of attention from our readers. Today we’re talking with Nora about all things incidents — the learning and growth they represent for teams, why teams should focus on learning from incidents in the first place, their Howie guide to post‑incident investigations, why the next emerging role is an Incident Analyst, and she also shares a few book recommendations which we’ve linked up in the show notes.

                    <span>Daniel Stenberg’s first step toward adding first-party JSON support to everyone’s favorite command-line URL transmitter is a flag that is basically a shortcut for the following flags:
--data [arg]
--header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;
--header &quot;Accept: application/json&quot;

Will more come of this? Time (and the community) will tell…
The discussion has been ignited in the curl community about what, if anything, we should do in curl to make it a smoother and better tool when working with JSON. The offered opinions range from nothing (“curl is content agnostic”) to full-fledged JSON generator, parser and pretty-printer (or a combination in between).

                    <span>Just wow. This is an impressively hacky hack. You’re probably wondering how? As many such things do, it all starts with a new (Chrome-only) API:
A new set of APIs affectionately known as Houdini give your browser the power to control CSS via its own Object Model in Javascript. In English, this means that you can make custom CSS styles, add custom properties, and so on…
And it ends with something that looks like this:
main {
  // ...
  --sql-query: SELECT name FROM test;
}

I have often been asked, “What is the most memorable bug that you have encountered in your testing career?” For me, it is hands down a bug that happened quite a few years ago. I was leading an Engineering Productivity team that supported Google App Engine. At that time App Engine was still in its early stages, and there were many challenges associated with testing rapidly evolving features. Our testing frameworks and processes were also evolving, so it was an exciting time to be on the team. 


What makes this bug so memorable is that I spent so much time developing a comprehensive suite of test scenarios, yet a failure occurred during such an obvious use case that it left me shaking my head and wondering how I had missed it. Even with many years of testing experience…</span>

                    <span>An interesting exploration of Tesla’s recent update to their in-car control screen that resulted from the author not being able to find the defogger control. Here’s an example of the kind of analysis he provides:
Edward Tufte has this visual rule that 1+1&#x3D;3. With a single line on the screen, you have just that single object, but adding a second line does something interesting, it adds a third ‘object’ on the screen, the negative space between the two. All good visual designers deeply understand this effect.
In UX design we have a cognitive equivalent. If you have two buttons, there is a third ‘object’ created, the decision a user must make on which button to tap. This cognitive load is invisible and rarely discussed but it can be a real source of confusion.

Two widely used npm libraries were self-sabotaged by their single maintainer, yet again, highlighting the many gaps in our OSS supply chain security, sustainability and overall practices. We explore all these topics and solution on what our ecosystem needs to be more resilient to these types of attacks in the future.

                    <span>I love how much hacking has been inspired by Wordle.
The Wordle source code contains 2,315 days of answers (all common 5-letter English words) and 10,657 other valid, less-common 5-letter English words.
We combine these to form a set of 12,972 possible words/answers.
We then simulate playing 1,000 Wordle games for each of these possible words, guessing based on the frequency of the word in the English language and the feedback received.
Then we take three measures to evaluate the observed distribution of ⬛🟨🟩 squares on Twitter according to our valid words.
The resulting code is included in the article.

                    <span>Lots of people talk about Kubernets’ complexity, but it’s rare for someone to attempt to plumb the depths of why exactly that is.
I don’t claim to have the full answer, but this post is an attempt to commit to paper two specific thoughts or paradigms I have that I reach for as I try to understand why working with Kubernetes feels so hairy sometimes.

They talk about the superpower of observability for developers, how she and Charity Majors got to the place to found Honeycomb, the state of their platform today, what exactly observability is, and their goals for the future of Honeycomb.

While the tooling is impressive, it’s the principles behind it that captivated Gerhard’s imagination. Vincent has a rather interesting take on the monorepository idea, including one change - one version - one deploy. There are a lot of interesting links in the show notes, including all the code that Vincent uses to manage infrastructure.
As a result of this conversation, Gerhard is running Nix on one of his Macs, and also started experimenting with his first NixOS production instance.

                    <span>Old as in old school cool not old as in passe:
Despite the new gatekeepers’ best efforts, the old Internet never completely disappeared. Personal websites created by individuals that have always been the meat of the old Internet are still around. They are still about exploration, innovation, fun, and all the rest. Try as the new gatekeepers have, they simply have not had the power to eradicate the old Internet completely. All they can do is pretend it does not exist. And, that is exactly what they do.
But…
… the old Internet seems to be slowly and quietly coming back, and it is coming back even better than before. Now it has better technology and an additional well-defined purpose that it never had before.
Some people have begun to refer to personal websites as the “indie web”, the “small Internet”, or the “smol Internet”. Some seem to reserve the last two terms exclusively for the Gemini Network, which nearly quadrupled in size last year. But, I think all three terms should also apply to some of the other networks that use alternative networking protocols–the Gopher Network, the Tor network, and the ZeroNet network, to name a few.

                    <span>Linux users on Tuesday got a major dose of bad news—a 12-year-old vulnerability in a system tool called Polkit gives attackers unfettered root privileges on machines running any major distribution of the open source operating system.
Previously called PolicyKit, Polkit manages system-wide privileges in Unix-like OSes. It provides a mechanism for nonprivileged processes to safely interact with privileged processes. It also allows users to execute commands with high privileges by using a component called pkexec, followed by the command.
Oh my. It requires local access first, which is the only good news here.

                    <span>PRQL (pronounced “Prequel”) aims to be “a simpler and more powerful SQL”
Like SQL, it’s readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it transpiles to SQL.
To get an idea on PRQL’s design, they provide this SQL statement as an example:
SELECT TOP 20
    title,
    country,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,
    AVG(salary + payroll_tax) AS average_gross_salary,
    SUM(salary + payroll_tax) AS sum_gross_salary,
    AVG(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS average_gross_cost,
    SUM(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
WHERE salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost &gt; 0 AND country &#x3D; &#x27;USA&#x27;
GROUP BY title, country
ORDER BY sum_gross_cost
HAVING count &gt; 200

let gross_salary &#x3D; salary + payroll_tax          # This _adds_ a column / variable.
let gross_cost   &#x3D; gross_salary + benefits_cost  # Variables can use other variables.

                    <span>Troy Hunt (of Have I been Pwned fame) has been a vocal proponent of cloud-first services for awhile. Last December, that strategy came back to bite him:
It all started with my monthly Azure bill for December which was way over what it would normally be. It only took a moment to find the problem…
He goes on to tell the tale in excruciating detail. Be careful out there, cloud natives.

                    <span>Rebuilding Wordle is a fun way to show off what your frontend framework is capable of (and how). Evan You has been doing just that for Vue. It’s not a 100% reproduction of the original, but it does have one cool feature the official game does NOT:
You can make your own Wordle and send it to friends by base64-encoding a word and include it as the URL query
Here’s a custom one using an acronym that many devs think about often…

                    <span>This week Paul Copplestone, CEO of Supabase joined us to catch us up on the next big thing happening in the world of Postgres. Supabase might be best known as “the open source Firebase alternative,” a tagline they might be reluctant to maintain. But from Adam’s perspective, he’s never been more excited about what they’re bringing to market for Postgres fans. In the last year, Supabase has gone from 0 to more than 80,000 databases on their platform — and they’re still in beta…and it’s open source. Hopefully today’s show sheds some light on why everyone is talking about Supabase.

                    <span>Wesley Aptekar-Cassels has been using NixOS on his main laptop for ~3 years and he’s ready to talk about it:
I don’t think that NixOS is the future, but I do absolutely think that the ideas in it are, so I want to write about what I think it gets right and what it gets wrong, in the hopes that other projects can take note. As such, this post will not assume knowledge of NixOS — if you’ve used NixOS significantly, there probably isn’t anything new in here for you.
