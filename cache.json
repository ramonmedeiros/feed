As email newsletters grow, RSS is a decent alternative to an increasingly cluttered email inbox.\nCreator incentives work against RSS. The protocol does not benefit content creators because it doesn’t give them any insight into their audience (number of subscribers, emails, or other data).\nWhat are your thoughts in his thoughts? What’s next for RSS?\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

The question is - what happens with the code once it is generated? Who is responsible for it and who will maintain and refactor it in the future?\nAlthough ML code generation helps with getting the initial code written, it cannot do much beyond that - if that code is to be maintained and changed in the future … the developer still needs to fully own and understand it.\nGenerated code accepted blindly is creating tech debt!\nIn other words, it means Copilot and similar solutions do not reduce the code complexity nor the amount of knowledge required to build features, they just help write the initial code faster, and bring the knowledge/examples closer to the code (which is really helpful). If a developer accepts the generated code blindly, they are just creating tech debt and pushing it forward.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

So you can use that as a nice tool to build out your jq syntax, or your jq query, and in real time get that feedback.\nThe only bummer is that it’s written in Ruby. Don’t get me wrong, I love Ruby.

Besides many small additions the spotlight is on a new incarnation of the Vim script language: Vim9 script.\nOne of Neovim’s major draws is that you can avoid Vim script altogether and use Lua instead. It looks like the Vim team is addressing the two major complaints folks have with Vim script: performance and its obscure syntax:\nThe main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.\nA secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer to commonly used programming languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript and Java.\nLegacy scripts will continue to work, of course. The Vim team has no plans to drop legacy support in the foreseeable future. Learn more about Vim9 script here or with :help vim9 inside Vim itself.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Now that Tauri is 1.0 I’m guessing adoption will really start to take off.\nEven more good news: we have an episode on Tauri in the hopper for ya 💪\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

We’ve also seen its potential to be helpful in addressing major global needs — like forecasting and planning humanitarian responses to natural disasters, addressing global environmental challenges, and delivering groundbreaking scientific research.\n\n\nAI is exciting — both from a technical perspective and when considering its underlying social benefits. And yet, to fully realize AI’s potential, it must be developed responsibly, thoughtfully and in a way that gives deep consideration to core ethical questions.

Or a picture of two robots having a romantic evening at the movies? These might sound far-fetched, but a novel type of machine learning technology called text-to-image generation makes them possible. These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.\nWithin Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques. After a lot of testing we recently announced two new text-to-image models — Imagen and Parti. Both have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches.
