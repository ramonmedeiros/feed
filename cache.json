Fly.io handles the annoying reverse proxy and SSL stuff, deployment is as simple as fly deploy, and there’s a nice dashboard on Fly.io to show me what’s going on…\nI’m only a few weeks into using Fly.io to host my side projects, but I’m very happy with their product so far. I was quite happy to delete the 500 lines of Ansible scripts, systemd unit files, and Caddy config files.\nIt also made me smile to finally stop the EC2 instance and bump my AWS bill down from $9 per month to about 10 cents per month (I still use S3 for user-uploaded images and for backups). I have nothing against EC2 and would use it again for certain things, but for small web applications, Fly.io seems like a great fit.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Sometimes that’s true, but sometimes the project is merely finished, and that’s okay. In fact, it’s better than okay. It’s downright successful.\nThere’s a big difference between quitting and finishing. Quitting is in the realm of failure, but finishing is in the realm of success.
