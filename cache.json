          "description": "Posted by Adrian Taylor, Chrome Security Team\nIf you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like 'exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild' have been appearing more often recently. In this post we'll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We'll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. \nHow things work today \nWhile the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it's because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it's actually a good thing! I…",

We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out” time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.\nIn addition to the author’s suggested solution to this problem allow me to add: developer retention! Nobody has more to figure out in a system than the people who just joined the team.

You would expect that a more standardized, all-around, full-proof solution is out there, but I am afraid there isn’t. It’s a complex matter and depending on what you are building, implementation varies.\nYou will probably start with a boolean admin flag in your User model and then you will replace it with a role field, as we all did. However, as things progress and the business model becomes more and more complex, so do the solutions that we need to implement in order to deal with that complexity.\nBut how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment?

Having documented the process required to set it up means that there is an answer to the question: How do I get this running?

We know the graph of all open source, which means we’re uniquely placed to innovate in interesting and exciting ways. This is exactly what tea will do. We’re taking our knowledge of how to make development more efficient and throwing innovations nobody has ever really considered before.\nWith plans to move the package registry on-chain, Max lays out the numerous benefits due to “inherent benefits of blockchain technology”:\nPackages will be immutable (no more left-pad incidents)\nPackages will always be available (we’ll use decentralized storage)\nReleases will be signed by the maintainers themselves (rather than a middleman you are told you can trust)\nTools can be built to fundamentally verify the integrity of your app’s open source constitution\nToken can flow through the graph\nMax says “token flowing is where things get really interesting,” and goes on to say “with our system people who care about the health of the open source ecosystem buy some token and stake it.”\n(Thanks to Omri Gabay for sharing this first in our community Slack)\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.\nHere’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:\nscript/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies\nscript/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time\nscript/update – updates a project to run at its current version\nscript/server – starts app\nscript/test – runs tests\nscript/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests\nscript/console – opens a console\nEach of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.\nNote: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Kubernetes is now the second-largest open source project after Linux, and it’s the big fish in the cloud native pond. But there are many other projects in the CNCF landscape and the broader cloud native community.\nSo, I thought I’d list some cloud native tools that can be very useful for teams that aren’t using Kubernetes or aren’t using it for every workload. Here are 7 of them that I like a lot.\nIf Rich’s name rings a bell, that’s because he was just on Ship It! last week. 😉\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript.

Let’s dig in!\nI built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I’ve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.\nHeck, even Chris’s disclaimer of ‘when SPAs make sense’ section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation.
