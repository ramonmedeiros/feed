          "description": "Posted by Martin Geisler, Android team\n\n\n\nAndroid 14 is the third major Android release with Rust support. We are already seeing a number of benefits:\n\n\n\nProductivity: Developers quickly feel productive writing Rust. They report important indicators of development velocity, such as confidence in the code quality and ease of code review.\n\nSecurity: There has been a reduction in memory safety vulnerabilities as we shift more development to memory safe languages.\n\n\n\nThese positive early results provided an enticing motivation to increase the speed and scope of Rust adoption. We hoped to accomplish this by investing heavily in training to expand from the early adopters.\n\nScaling up from Early Adopters\nTraining Engineers\nQuickly ramp up engineers: It is hard to take people away from their regul…",

          "description": "Jess McClintock and John Dethridge, Google Open Source Security Team, and Damien Miller, Enterprise Infrastructure Protection Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you import a third party library, do you review every line of code? Most software packages depend on external libraries, trusting that those packages aren’t doing anything unexpected. If that trust is violated, the consequences can be huge—regardless of whether the package is malicious, or well-intended but using overly broad permissions, such as with Log4j in 2021. Supply chain security is a growing issue, and we hope that greater transparency into package capabilities will help make secure coding easier for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding bad dependencies can be hard without appropriate information on what the dependency’s code actually does, and reviewing…",

          "description": "Posted by Hamzeh Zawawy and Jon Bottarini, Android Security\n\n\nFuzzing is an effective technique for finding software vulnerabilities. Over the past few years Android has been focused on improving the effectiveness, scope, and convenience of fuzzing across the organization. This effort has directly resulted in improved test coverage, fewer security/stability bugs, and higher code quality. Our implementation of continuous fuzzing allows software teams to find new bugs/vulnerabilities, and prevent regressions automatically without having to manually initiate fuzzing runs themselves. This post recounts a brief history of fuzzing on Android, shares how Google performs fuzzing at scale, and documents our experience, challenges, and success in building an infrastructure for automating fuzzing acr…",
