          "description": "Nicolas Lidzborski, Principal Engineer and Jaishankar Sundararaman, Sr. Director of Engineering, Google Workspace\n\n\n\nIn February, we expanded Google Workspace client-side encryption (CSE) capabilities to include Gmail and Calendar in addition to Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet.\nCSE in Gmail was designed to provide commercial and public sector organizations an additional layer of confidentiality and data integrity protection beyond the existing encryption offered by default in Workspace. When CSE is enabled, email messages are protected using encryption keys that are fully under the customer’s control. The data is encrypted on the client device before it’s sent to Google servers that do not have access to the encryption keys, which means the data is indecipherable to us–we have no tec…",

With attacks targeting software supply chains sharply rising, open source developers need to monitor and judge the risks of the projects they rely on. Our previous installment of the Supply chain security for Go series shared the ecosystem tools available to Go developers to manage their dependencies and vulnerabilities.
