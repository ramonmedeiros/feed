We particularly prioritize hardening the cellular baseband given its unique combination of running in an elevated privilege and parsing untrusted inputs that are remotely delivered into the device.\n\n\nThis post covers how to use two high-value sanitizers which can prevent specific classes of vulnerabilities found within the baseband. They are architecture agnostic, suitable for bare-metal deployment, and should be enabled in existing C/C++ code bases to mitigate unknown vulnerabilities. Beyond security, addressing the issues uncovered by these sanitizers improves code health and overall s‚Ä¶",

You can download a printer-friendly version to display in your office.\n\n\nby Yiming Sun\n\n\nHave you ever seen huge exception-handling blocks? Here is an example. Let's assume we are calling bakePizza() to bake a pizza, and it can be overbaked, throwing a PizzaOverbakedException.\n\n\n\n\nclass PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};\n\n\nvoid bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};\n\n\ntry {\n¬†¬†// 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.\n¬†¬†...\n¬†¬†bakePizza();\n¬†¬†// Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.\n¬†¬†...\n} catch (Exception e) {\n¬†¬†throw new IllegalStateException(); // Root cause ignored while throwing new exception.\n}\n\n\n\nHere are the problems with the above code:\n\nObscuring the logic. The method bakePizza(), is obscured by the additional lines of code of preparation and delivery, so unintended exceptions from preparation and delivery may be caught.\nCatching the general exception. catch (Exception e) will catch everything, despite that we might only want to handle PizzaOverbakedException here.\nRethrowing a general exception, with the original exception ignored. This means that the root cause is lost - we don't know what exactly goes wrong with pizza baking while debugging.\n\nHere is a better alternative, rewritten to avoid the problems above.\n\n\n\nclass PizzaOverbakedException extends Exception {};\n\nvoid bakePizza () throws PizzaOverbakedException {};\n\n// 100+ lines of code to prepare pizza ingredients.\n...\ntry {\n¬†¬†bakePizza();\n} catch (PizzaOverbakedException e) { ¬†// Other exceptions won‚Äôt be caught.\n¬†¬†// Rethrow a more meaningful exception; so that we know pizza is overbaked.\n¬†¬†throw new IllegalStateException(‚ÄúYou burned the pizza!‚Äù, e);¬†¬†\n}\n// Another 100+ lines of code to deliver pizza to a customer.\n...",
