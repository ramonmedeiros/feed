It kind of depends on the project.\nToday I‚Äôm taking this one step further, and I‚Äôm introducing a new concept: extremely linear git history.\nWith our extremely linear history, the first commit in a repo hash a hash that starts with 0000000, the second commit is 0000001, the third is 0000002, and so on!\nHow he accomplishes this is perhaps even more interesting (and hacky!)\n\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Well, Retool (a Changelog sponsor) can consider themselves flattered, because Openblocks sets out to do openly what they‚Äôve been doing proprietarily. Here‚Äôs why:\nIt‚Äôs cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.\nLow-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.\nRetool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.\nOpenblocks wants to take a step forward.

You may have to answer that question for yourself, but this post shares some good thoughts around designing a modular monolith:\nWhen designing a modular monolith, it is all about breaking up the system into modules, and then combining those modules into a monolith for deployment.\nIt might be worth noting that finding what modules you will need, might not be as easy as you would think. They have to be as independent as possible. High-cohesion and low coupling is very important here, as all communication between the modules might end up being a cross network call, if you decide to break it into services in the future.\nThis means that all communication between modules need to well abstracted, and be either asynchronous, so that they can handle the call going across the network in the future, or use some form of messaging.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

I had limited resources. Limited documentation. I had so many limitations. I ran into them constantly and eventually found the next thing I could use to do cool stuff. If you try to teach someone to use an HTML form today, you will need to decide if you are talking about the basic idea or reality. Do we need to cover CSRF, captchas and how to do it in React? How about the backend? Starting out, I didn‚Äôt hear about half of the things I didn‚Äôt know; I think that made things easier.\nWhen it comes to the software industry, this is the best of times. There are amazing learning resources available, a vast repository of free code that you don‚Äôt have to write, and lucrative job offers on the other end of the chasm.\nWhen it comes to the software industry, this is the worst of times. There are too many learning resources to choose from, a crippling repository of free code that might stumble you, and overwhelming imposter syndrome on the other end of the chasm.\nLars sums it up nicely:\nHand someone a fish and they‚Äôll never know that the ocean is vast.

As SVP of Technology and Society, part of my work at Google is connecting people and ideas to help shape the future of our most ambitious technology and its impact on society, and to do it responsibly.\n\n\nAn important part of that is talking to and learning from experts in a variety of fields and disciplines. Recently I sat down with a brilliant friend, New York Times columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman, to compare notes and discuss some big questions on our minds.\n\n\n\n\nThomas Friedman and James Manyika in conversation at Google‚Äôs Bay View campus.\n\n\n\nWe had a lot to cover, as it had been a couple of years since our last such in-person conversation due to the pandemic. Much of our discussion focused on AI and how it affects society, but we also discussed what Tom has been observing, how we as a society shape technology, and why we think this moment in time is an inflection point akin to the printing press or the industrial revolution.\n\n\nTo close our conversation, I asked Tom what keeps him optimistic about the future. His answer reinforces my belief that getting technology right is a collective responsibility involving the whole of society ‚Äî from open, honest conversations like this to better understand the opportunities and challenges, to defining policy, and responsibly creating new and societally-beneficial applications.\n\n\nI always learn something new when I have these conversations with Tom, and I‚Äôm excited to share more insights and dialogues on YouTube soon.\n\n\nVisit YouTubeto see more of James‚Äô conversation with Thomas Friedman.",

Back then, many people in the AI community were excited about the potential of neural networks, which were impressive, but couldn‚Äôt yet accomplish important, real-world tasks. I was excited, too! I did my senior thesis on using parallel computation to train neural networks, thinking we only needed 32X more compute power to get there. I was way off. At that time, we needed 1 million times as much computational power.\n\n\nA short 21 years later, with exponentially more computational power, it was time to take another crack at neural networks.
