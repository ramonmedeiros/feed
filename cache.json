          "description": "Posted by Adrian Taylor, Chrome Security Team\nIf you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like 'exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild' have been appearing more often recently. In this post we'll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We'll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. \nHow things work today \nWhile the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it's because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it's actually a good thing! I…",

          "description": "Posted by Ard Biesheuvel, Google Open Source Security Team \n\nLinux kernel support for the 32-bit ARM architecture was contributed in the late 90s, when there was little corporate involvement in Linux development, and most contributors were students or hobbyists, tinkering with development boards, often without much in the way of documentation.\n\n\nNow 20+ years later, 32-bit ARM's maintainer has downgraded its support level to 'odd fixes,' while remaining active as a kernel contributor. This is a common pattern for aging and obsolete architectures: corporate funding for Linux kernel development has tremendously increased the pace of development, but only for architectures with a high return on investment. As a result, the 32-bit ARM port of Linux is essentially in maintenance-only mode, and …",

You describe the options, parameters, and subcommands in comments like this:\n# @describe A demo cli\n\n# @cmd Upload a file\n# @arg target!                      File to upload\nupload() {\n    echo \"cmd                       upload\"\n    echo \"arg:  target              $argc_target\"\n}\n\nThen you trust Argc to parse that and do the heavy lifting:\neval \"$(argc -e $0 \"$@\")\"\n\nThe only drawback (aside from potential parsing bugs) to this approach is your script now depends on having argc in the machine’s executable path. i.e. – it’s not portable.\nWhat’d be even cooler, IMHO, would be to instead use argc as a pre-processor of sorts that spits out a pure-bash implementation from your input script.

After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.\nToday, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!\nI built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I’ve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.\nHeck, even Chris’s disclaimer of ‘when SPAs make sense’ section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation.
