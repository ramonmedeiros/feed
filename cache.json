The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform remote code execution by exploiting the insecure JNDI lookups feature exposed by the logging library log4j. This exploitable feature was enabled by default in many versions of the library.\n\n\nThis vulnerability has captivated the information security ecosystem since its disclosure on December 9th because of both its severity and widespread impact.

Hopefully, after reading this post you’ll have a better understanding of what generics can do for you and what they can’t.\nMark shares lots of good tips along the way. His findings are quite positive:\nI ❤️ that I was able to delete 95% of my code because of generics.\nI think that generics will be very beneficial to maintainers who create libraries for things like my own as well as for searching, sorting, transformations, and the like. I can also see some them being extremely helpful for creating well-tested libraries around the various concurrency patterns that are sometimes tricky to get right.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Here’s a direct quote from Richard Hipp in that episode.\nOriginally we thought we were gonna sell this and make money from it, and that’s how we were gonna support ongoing development. That didn’t really play out, nobody ever bought it. It does sort of become our business value, our intellectual property. I mean, you can take the SQLite code and fork it and start your own thing…but you don’t have the full test suite. You’ve got a lot of tests, but not all of them.

We would spend time and effort on the silly parts and we would need to spend testing and energy on these jokes instead of the real thing.

Property tests take more effort to write. They force you to think hard about what the code is doing, and what its expected behaviour should be. It’s hard work. And on top of that, running 100+ tests is always going to take longer than running 3–5 example-based tests. This cost is real, and it raises the question:\nHow do we keep ourselves from over-specifying or writing unnecessary tests?\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Core library developers are finally seeing the benefits of maintaining compatibility. Despite this, many developers are not interested in depending on a stable base of libraries for binary software. Instead, they have decided to ignore and override almost all libraries pre-installed on the user’s system.\nAnd why the author thinks Flatpak (which some believe is the future) is not the way to go.\nI am not a fan. I’m going to outline here some of the technical, security and usability problems with Flatpak and others.

Stylish has over three million.
