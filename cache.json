Users may be tricked into sharing sensitive information like their passwords with a misleading or fake website, also called phishing. They may also be led into installing malicious software on their machines, called malware, which can collect personal data and also hold it for ransom. Google Chrome, henceforth called Chrome, enables its users to protect themselves from such threats on the internet. When Chrome users browse the web with Safe Browsing protections, Chrome uses the Safe Browsing service from Google to identify and ward off various threats. \nSafe Browsing works in different ways depending on the user's preferences.

But I (try to) do it with love, because language design is just one part of what makes a programming environment good. This post is a nice reminder of the many reasons why PHP and JavaScript are awesome.\nOver the last twenty years, I have used over a dozen languages professionally, from C to Common Lisp, from Java to Python, from C++ to Typescript.\nYet, I love janky programming languages. In particular, I really enjoy PHP and JavaScript.\nHere’s why.\nI particularly agree with the point at the end about legacy codebases, many of which are powered by PHP and JS:\nA legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.\nFor me, nothing comes close to the pleasure of improving a product with many users.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Additionally, I’ll discuss areas where the Elixir ecosystem still comes up short, and using Nx for a new project might not be the best idea.\nSean is a prominent member of the Elixir community, so that’s the perspective on display here, but it’s a thorough and well-reasoned comparison. He concludes:\nWhile there are still many gaps in the Elixir ecosystem, the progress over the last year has been rapid.

Most of them have looked something like what the author describes:\nthe technique has some major downsides. The first is that soft deletion logic bleeds out into all parts of your code. All our selects look something like this:\nSELECT *\nFROM customer\nWHERE id = @id\n    AND deleted_at IS NULL;\n\nAnd forgetting that extra predicate on deleted_at can have dangerous consequences as it accidentally returns data that’s no longer meant to be seen.\nORMs help with this, but not enough. You set it as a default scope and then there’s that one time where you also want the deleted records so you come up with a custom query or dig into your ORM and try to find how to bypass the rule. Yuck!\nHe goes on to describe other problems as well. Maybe it’s all a big case of YAGNI?\nOnce again, soft deletion is theoretically a hedge against accidental data loss. As a last argument against it, I’d ask you to consider, realistically, whether undeletion is something that’s ever actually done.\nWhen I worked at Heroku, we used soft deletion.\nWhen I worked at Stripe, we used soft deletion.\nAt my job right now, we use soft deletion.\nAs far as I’m aware, never once, in ten plus years, did anyone at any of these places ever actually use soft deletion to undelete something.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

For example, if a person tells you, “I am running out of time,” you don’t immediately worry they are jogging on a street where the space-time continuum ceases to exist. You understand that they’re probably coming up against a deadline. And if they hurriedly walk toward a closed door, you don’t brace for a collision, because you trust this person can open the door, whether by turning a knob or pulling a handle.\n\n\nA robot doesn’t innately have that understanding. And that’s the inherent challenge of programming helpful robots that can interact with humans. We know it as “Moravec's paradox” — the idea that in robotics, it’s the easi…",
