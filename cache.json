In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what‚Äôs in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it‚Äôs impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components‚Äîincluding those produced by others.

Besides many small additions the spotlight is on a new incarnation of the Vim script language: Vim9 script.\nOne of Neovim‚Äôs major draws is that you can avoid Vim script altogether and use Lua instead. It looks like the Vim team is addressing the two major complaints folks have with Vim script: performance and its obscure syntax:\nThe main goal of Vim9 script is to drastically improve performance. This is accomplished by compiling commands into instructions that can be efficiently executed. An increase in execution speed of 10 to 100 times can be expected.\nA secondary goal is to avoid Vim-specific constructs and get closer to commonly used programming languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript and Java.\nLegacy scripts will continue to work, of course. The Vim team has no plans to drop legacy support in the foreseeable future. Learn more about Vim9 script here or with :help vim9 inside Vim itself.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

But as Google‚Äôs AI Principles note, it‚Äôs sometimes necessary to have human intervention to identify risks of unfair bias.\n\n\nSunipa Dev is a research scientist at Google who focuses on Responsible AI.

These models can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt.\nWithin Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques.
