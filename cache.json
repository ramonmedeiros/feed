          "description": "Posted by Caleb Brown, Open Source Security Team \n\n\nDespite open source software’s essential role in all software built today, it’s far too easy for bad actors to circulate malicious packages that attack the systems and users running that software. Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute. As a result, malicious packages like ua-parser-js, and node-ipc are regularly uploaded to popular repositories despite their best efforts, with sometimes devastating consequences for users. \nGoogle, a member of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), is proud to support the OpenSSF’s Package Analysis project, w…",

But with this flexibility can come a bewildering array of options for beginners—much like salsa dancing, someone just starting out might be left on the dance floor wondering how and where to jump in.\nThough it’s tempting to try to establish a single standard for how to use SLSA, it’s not possible: SLSA is not a line dance where everyone does the same moves, at the same time, to the same song.
