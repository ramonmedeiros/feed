I wanted to give them control over their data and to be able to store it locally to open and edit later. And also easily share it with other people. It’s easy to do this by supporting file upload/download, but I wanted something simpler, like the ability to share by sending a url. I also didn’t want to store anything on the backend (at least for the free tier).\nWhat he decided on was to base64 encode the entire application state and store it in the fragment section of the URL. I love all the upsides of this approach and it’s pretty trivial to accomplish. Here’s the pseudocode that Scott provides in his post:\nconst stateString = JSON.stringify(appState); // appState is a json object\nconst compressed = compress(stateString);\nconst encoded = Base64.encode(compressed);\n// Push that `encoded` string to the url\n// ... Later, on page load or on undo/redo we read the url and\n// do the following\nconst decoded = Base64.decode(encoded); // same encoded as above, but read from url\nconst uncompressed = uncompress(decoded);\nconst newState = JSON.parse(uncompressed);\n// Now load your application with the newState\n\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Goodhart’s Law is about as pithy and about as practicable as “the only certainty in life is death and taxes” and “hell is other people.” It is descriptive; it tells you of the existence of a phenomenon, but it doesn’t tell you what to do about it or how to solve it.\nThere are more useful formulations of the law that help solve it. Some organizations use this narrower, more actionable form:\nWhen people are pressured to meet a target value there are three ways they can proceed:\nThey can work to improve the system\nThey can distort the system\nOr they can distort the data\nWith that framing in hand, Cedric goes on to describe how you can solve for these three ways and design incentive/measurement systems that work.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

          "description": "A long-standing debate between me and a peer at work has been how we should name services. His position was always that services should be named something descriptive, so that you can infer from the name what it does. My position is that the name should definitely not be descriptive, but should be something cute and wholly disconnected from the purpose. And I think this applies more broadly to projects and companies, too.\nNicholas’ reason for cute names winning comes down to the inevitably of change in a service/project’s function and the difficulty in renaming things. I hadn’t thought of that argument, but I already agreed with the premise.\nWe also apply this thinking to podcast episode names, which can be a mixed bag because descriptive titles certainly help when it comes to discovery. As Adam and I discussed on our recent State of the “log” episode, if you see use a descriptive title, it’s most likely because we couldn’t think of a good cute/interesting one.\nBut that’s just our opinion about episode naming.

          "description": "Sometimes all a project needs is the ability to read/write small amounts of JSON data and have it saved in some persistent storage. Imagine a simple data-model which receives infrequent updates and could be represented as JSON object. It doesn’t demand a full-blown database, but it would be neat to have a way to interact with this data and have it persist across sessions.\nThis is where gist-database comes in handy, by leveraging the power of the gist api you can easily create a key/value data-store for your project.\nThis is a perfect solution for low write / high read scenarios when serving static site content with Next.js and using Incremental Static Regeneration to keep your cached content fresh.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
