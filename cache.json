The most common type of memory safety bug is the ‚Äúuse-after-free‚Äù. We recently posted about an exciting series of technologies designed to prevent these. Those technologies (collectively, *Scan, pronounced ‚Äústar scan‚Äù) are very powerful but likely require hardware support for sufficient performance. \nToday we‚Äôre going to talk about a different approach to solving the same type of bugs. \nIt‚Äôs hard, if not impossible, to avoid use-after-frees in a non-trivial codebase.

This one is almost clich√© at this point, but still quite true.\nFocus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don‚Äôt have anyone to work on them except the founders.

Mi≈Çosz Piechocki makes the distinction this way:\nJunior Engineers care about writing Software. They value code quality, employ best practices, try to adopt cutting-edge technologies. They invest a lot of time into learning new technologies. To them, the ultimate goal is to create elegant, performant, maintainable software.\nSenior Engineers care about building Systems. To them, creating software is just one of the steps. First of all, they question whether the software needs to be built in the first place. They ask what problems would it solve and why it‚Äôs important to solve them. They inquire who will be using the software and on what scale. They think about where the software would run and how they‚Äôre going to monitor whether it‚Äôs working properly. They also decide how to measure whether the software is actually solving the problems it was supposed to solve.\nHe goes on to describe how hard it is to build Systems and lists activities that are part of that process.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Signals are based on reactive principles and provide excellent developer ergonomics, with a unique implementation optimized for Virtual DOM.\nAdding Signals to your Preact app only adds 1.6kB to your bundle size. So what‚Äôs the big idea?\nThe main idea behind signals is that instead of passing a value directly through the component tree, we pass a signal object containing the value (similar to a ref). When a signal‚Äôs value changes, the signal itself stays the same. As a result, signals can be updated without re-rendering the components they‚Äôve been passed through, since components see the signal and not its value. This lets us skip all of the expensive work of rendering components and jump immediately to the specific components in the tree that actually access the signal‚Äôs value.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
