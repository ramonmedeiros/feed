          "description": "Posted by GKE and Anthos Platform Security Teams \n\n\n\nAt the KubeCon EU 2022 conference in Valencia, security researchers from Palo Alto Networks presented research findings on “trampoline pods”—pods with an elevated set of privileges required to do their job, but that could conceivably be used as a jumping off point to gain escalated privileges.\nThe research mentions GKE, including how developers should look at the privileged pod problem today, what the GKE team is doing to minimize the use of privileged pods, and actions GKE users can take to protect their clusters.\nPrivileged pods within the context of GKE security\n\nWhile privileged pods can pose a security issue, it’s important to look at them within the overall context of GKE security. To use a privileged pod as a “trampoline” in GKE, …",

But phishing persistently remains a threat (as shown by a recent phishing attack on the U.S. Department of Labor) because users retain the ability to log into their online accounts, often with a simple password, from anywhere in the world. It’s why today at I/O we announced new ways we’re reducing the risks of phishing by: scaling phishing protections to Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, continuing to auto enroll people in 2-Step Verification and more.

Unlike mobile app stores that can scan for and reject malicious contributions, package repositories have limited resources to review the thousands of daily updates and must maintain an open model where anyone can freely contribute.
