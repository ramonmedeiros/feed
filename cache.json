          "description": "Posted by Adrian Taylor, Chrome Security Team\nIf you are a regular reader of our Chrome release blog, you may have noticed that phrases like 'exploit for CVE-1234-567 exists in the wild' have been appearing more often recently. In this post we'll explore why there seems to be such an increase in exploits, and clarify some misconceptions in the process. We'll then share how Chrome is continuing to make it harder for attackers to achieve their goals. \nHow things work today \nWhile the increase may initially seem concerning, it’s important to understand the reason behind this trend. If it's because there are many more exploits in the wild, it could point to a worrying trend. On the other hand, if we’re simply gaining more visibility into exploitation by attackers, it's actually a good thing! I…",

This allows GUI tools to be used on remote SQLite databases which can make administration easier.\nThe proxy works by translating Postgres frontend wire messages into SQLite transactions and converting results back into Postgres response wire messages. Many Postgres clients also inspect the pg_catalog to determine system information so Postlite mirrors this catalog by using an attached in-memory database with virtual tables. The proxy also performs minor rewriting on these system queries to convert them to usable SQLite syntax.\nIt appears that Ben is taking code contributions this time around, but only for bug & documentation fixes.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

We talk often about how we build systems, but how often do you talk about how you spend the “figuring out” time? If we do not talk about it, it’s not explicit. If it’s not explicit, it does not get optimized.\nIn addition to the author’s suggested solution to this problem allow me to add: developer retention! Nobody has more to figure out in a system than the people who just joined the team.

However, as things progress and the business model becomes more and more complex, so do the solutions that we need to implement in order to deal with that complexity.\nBut how do you actually go from a simple flag to Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and then to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), especially in a microservices environment?

          "description": "Where by “auditing” they mean change tracking, not security testing:\nAuditing is particularly useful for historical analysis. To demonstrate, imagine you have a users table that tracks when a user is online. You might add a status column which can have one of two values: online and offline. How would you track how long a user is online for throughout an entire month? An auditing system would track every change with timestamps, and so you can measure the difference between each timestamp and sum them up for the entire month.\nWhat really impresses me about the Supabase team is how much they’re leaning in to Postgres’ rich feature set to build high-quality-yet-low-level abstractions for their users. Paul Copplestone emphasized this when we had him on the show back in January.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.\nHere’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:\nscript/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies\nscript/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time\nscript/update – updates a project to run at its current version\nscript/server – starts app\nscript/test – runs tests\nscript/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests\nscript/console – opens a console\nEach of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work. This makes them composable, easy to call from other scripts, and easy to understand.\nNote: this was written basically forever ago, but it’s still a relevant and effective solution.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.\nC is the lingua franca of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak.\nAnd just in case these pull quotes leave you with the impression that Aria is happy about the situation… yeah, nope.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
