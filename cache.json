          "description": "Posted by Eugene Liderman and Roger Piqueras Jover \n\n\nSMS texting is frozen in time.\n\n\nPeople still use and rely on trillions of SMS texts each year to exchange messages with friends, share family photos, and copy two-factor authentication codes to access sensitive data in their bank accounts. It’s hard to believe that at a time where technologies like AI are transforming our world, a forty-year old mobile messaging standard is still so prevalent.\n\n\nLike any forty-year-old technology, SMS is antiquated compared to its modern counterparts. That’s especially concerning when it comes to security.\n\n\nThe World Has Changed, But SMS Hasn’t Changed With It\n\n\nAccording to a recent whitepaper from Dekra, a safety certifications and testing lab, the security shortcomings of SMS can notably lead to: \n…",

          "description": "Posted by Martin Geisler, Android team\n\n\n\nAndroid 14 is the third major Android release with Rust support. We are already seeing a number of benefits:\n\n\n\nProductivity: Developers quickly feel productive writing Rust. They report important indicators of development velocity, such as confidence in the code quality and ease of code review.\n\nSecurity: There has been a reduction in memory safety vulnerabilities as we shift more development to memory safe languages.\n\n\n\nThese positive early results provided an enticing motivation to increase the speed and scope of Rust adoption. We hoped to accomplish this by investing heavily in training to expand from the early adopters.\n\nScaling up from Early Adopters\nTraining Engineers\nQuickly ramp up engineers: It is hard to take people away from their regul…",

Most software packages depend on external libraries, trusting that those packages aren’t doing anything unexpected. If that trust is violated, the consequences can be huge—regardless of whether the package is malicious, or well-intended but using overly broad permissions, such as with Log4j in 2021. Supply chain security is a growing issue, and we hope that greater transparency into package capabilities will help make secure coding easier for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding bad dependencies can be hard without appropriate information on what the dependency’s code actually does, and reviewing…",

This is a technical analysis of the final stage of one of the exploit chains, specifically CVE-2023-0266 (a 0-day in the ALSA compatibility layer) and CVE-2023-26083 (a 0-day in the Mali GPU driver) as well as the techniques used by the attacker to gain kernel arbitrary read/write access.\n\nNotably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities:\n\n\nCVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a \"Chrome n-day\"), was used to achieve RCE.\n\n\nCVE-2022-3038, another Chrome n-…",
