          "description": "Posted by Ard Biesheuvel, Google Open Source Security Team¬†\n\nLinux kernel support for the 32-bit ARM architecture was contributed in the late 90s, when there was little corporate involvement in Linux development, and most contributors were students or hobbyists, tinkering with development boards, often without much in the way of documentation.\n\n\nNow 20+ years later, 32-bit ARM's maintainer has downgraded its support level to 'odd fixes,' while remaining active as a kernel contributor. This is a common pattern for aging and obsolete architectures: corporate funding for Linux kernel development has tremendously increased the pace of development, but only for architectures with a high return on investment. As a result, the 32-bit ARM port of Linux is essentially in maintenance-only mode, and ‚Ä¶",
