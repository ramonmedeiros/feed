          "description": "Juan José López Jaimez, Security Researcher and Meador Inge, Security Engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are announcing Buzzer, a new eBPF Fuzzing framework that aims to help hardening the Linux Kernel.\nWhat is eBPF and how does it verify safety?\n\neBPF is a technology that allows developers and sysadmins to easily run programs in a privileged context, like an operating system kernel. Recently, its popularity has increased, with more products adopting it as, for example, a network filtering solution. At the same time, it has maintained its relevance in the security research community, since it provides a powerful attack surface into the operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there are many solutions for fuzzing vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel, they are not necessarily tailored to the unique features of eBP…",

This happens in the Chrome default browser and also in Android WebView, when you open web content from apps. \n\n\nSafe Browsing is getting a big upgrade with a new real-time API that helps ensure you’re warned about fast-emerging malicious sites. With the newest version of Safe Browsing, devices will do real-time blocklist checks for low reputation sites.

They are designed to enhance online security for users. Because they are based on the public key cryptographic protocols that underpin security keys, they are resistant to phishing and other online attacks, making them more secure than SMS, app based one-time passwords and other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
