In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what‚Äôs in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it‚Äôs impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components‚Äîincluding those produced by others. This increased interest in SBOMs saw another boost after the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released its Secure Software Development Framework, which requires SBOM information t‚Ä¶",

We paid a total of $8.7 million in rewards, our highest amount yet. 2021 saw some amazing work from the security research community. It is worth noting that a significant portion of the reports we received were for findings in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products. It is heartening to see an increasing number of talented researchers getting involved in cloud security.\nWe first announced the GCP VRP Prize in 2019 to encourage security researchers to focus on the security of GCP, in turn helping us make GCP more secure for our users, customers, and the internet at large.

As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we‚Äôve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.\nAtom was co-founder and long-time CEO Chris Wanstrath‚Äôs baby.

Like any good 2.0 they added a ton more fields, features, removed character limits and it was suddenly ID3v2. The latest spec is ID3v2.4 while the most commonly adopted one seems to be ID3v2.3.

This gap is what many M&A prospects bring to the table.
