Fortunately, they can now improve their image and container security by harnessing Google-grade vulnerability scanning, which offers expanded open-source coverage. A significant benefit of utilizing Google Cloud Platform is its integrated security tools, including Artifact Analysis. This scanning service leverages the same infrastructure that Google depends on to monitor vulnerabilities within its internal systems and software supply chains.\n\n\n\nArtifact Analysis has recently expanded its scanning coverage to eight additional l…",

Introduced at Android Bootcamp in April, Vanir gives Android platform developers the power to quickly and efficiently scan their custom platform code for missing security patches and identify applicable available patches. Vanir significantly accelerates patch validation by automating this process, allowing OEMs to ensure devices are protected with critical security updates much faster than traditional methods. This strengthens the security of the Android ecosystem, helping to keep Android users around the world safe. \nBy open-sou…",
