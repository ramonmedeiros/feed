In the wake of the 2021 Executive Order on Cybersecurity, these ingredient labels for software became popular as a way to understand what‚Äôs in the software we all consume. The guiding idea is that it‚Äôs impossible to judge the risks of particular software without knowing all of its components‚Äîincluding those produced by others.
