          "description": "Posted by Laurent Simon and Azeem Shaikh, Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST) \n\n\n\nSince our July announcement of Scorecards V2, the Scorecards project—an automated security tool to flag risky supply chain practices in open source projects—has grown steadily to over 40 unique contributors and 18 implemented security checks. Today we are proud to announce the V4 release of Scorecards, with larger scaling, a new security check, and a new Scorecards GitHub Action for easier security automation.\nThe Scorecards Action is released in partnership with GitHub and is available from GitHub's Marketplace. The Action makes using Scorecards easier than ever: it runs automatically on repository changes to alert developers about risky supply-chain practices. Maintainers can view the alerts on GitHub's code scanning dashboard, which is available for free to public repositories on GitHub.com and via GitHub Advanced Security for private repositories. \nAdditionally, we have scaled our weekly Scorecards scans to over one million GitHub repositories, and have partnered with the Open Source Insights website for easy user access to the data. \nFor more details about the release, including the new Dangerous-Workflow security check, visit the OpenSSF's official blog post here.",

          "description": "By George Pirocanac\n\n\nI have often been asked, “What is the most memorable bug that you have encountered in your testing career?” For me, it is hands down a bug that happened quite a few years ago. I was leading an Engineering Productivity team that supported Google App Engine. At that time App Engine was still in its early stages, and there were many challenges associated with testing rapidly evolving features. Our testing frameworks and processes were also evolving, so it was an exciting time to be on the team. \n\n\nWhat makes this bug so memorable is that I spent so much time developing a comprehensive suite of test scenarios, yet a failure occurred during such an obvious use case that it left me shaking my head and wondering how I had missed it. Even with many years of testing experience…",

Personal websites created by individuals that have always been the meat of the old Internet are still around. They are still about exploration, innovation, fun, and all the rest. Try as the new gatekeepers have, they simply have not had the power to eradicate the old Internet completely. All they can do is pretend it does not exist. And, that is exactly what they do.\nBut…\n… the old Internet seems to be slowly and quietly coming back, and it is coming back even better than before. Now it has better technology and an additional well-defined purpose that it never had before.\nSome people have begun to refer to personal websites as the “indie web”, the “small Internet”, or the “smol Internet”. Some seem to reserve the last two terms exclusively for the Gemini Network, which nearly quadrupled in size last year. But, I think all three terms should also apply to some of the other networks that use alternative networking protocols–the Gopher Network, the Tor network, and the ZeroNet network, to name a few.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it transpiles to SQL.\nTo get an idea on PRQL’s design, they provide this SQL statement as an example:\nSELECT TOP 20\n    title,\n    country,\n    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,\n    SUM(salary) AS sum_salary,\n    AVG(salary + payroll_tax) AS average_gross_salary,\n    SUM(salary + payroll_tax) AS sum_gross_salary,\n    AVG(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS average_gross_cost,\n    SUM(salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost) AS sum_gross_cost,\n    COUNT(*) as count\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary + payroll_tax + benefits_cost > 0 AND country = 'USA'\nGROUP BY title, country\nORDER BY sum_gross_cost\nHAVING count > 200\n\nAnd then translate it to PRQL, which looks like:\nfrom employees\nfilter country = \"USA\"                           # Each line transforms the previous result.\nlet gross_salary = salary + payroll_tax          # This _adds_ a column / variable.\nlet gross_cost   = gross_salary + benefits_cost  # Variables can use other variables.\nfilter gross_cost > 0\naggregate by:[title, country] [                  # `by` are the columns to group by.\n    average salary,                              # These are the calcs to run on the groups.\n    sum     salary,\n    average gross_salary,\n    sum     gross_salary,\n    average gross_cost,\n    sum     gross_cost,\n    count,\n]\nsort sum_gross_cost                              # Uses the auto-generated column name.\nfilter count > 200\ntake 20\n\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Maintenance is what we’re really talking about. When parts on our car or bicycle suffers wear from driving them around, we don’t talk to our mechanic about “mechanical debt”. (Go back and re-read that sentence, but replace things with “software” and “programmers”). We talk about maintenance.\nThis post starts as mostly a semantic debate, and I’m not convinced by his arguments there. I think the debt metaphor is useful when you’re talking about trading quality for speed. That’s what you do when you take on debt: you trade higher cost at a future date (principle + interest) to gain access to the money today (speed).\nThat being said, I really like where Jesse ends this piece talking about software maintenance and methods of going about it. Lots of actionable advice there and I’m 100% onboard with talking about software maintenance early and often. One of the first things I consider when somebody approaches me with a feature idea is ask myself: what will this cost to maintain?\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider & ISP based in Sussex, UK.\nGerhard’s Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue. Drew helped Gerhard realise that it actually was. Not only has Gerhard’s DNS latency improved by 3x, but he can now fail-over between two WAN connections.
