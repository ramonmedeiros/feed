Today, we’re happy to announce an expansion of our OSS-Fuzz Rewards Program, plus new features in OSS-Fuzz and our involvement in supporting academic fuzzing research. \nRefreshed OSS-Fuzz rewards \n  \nThe OSS-Fuzz project's purpose is to support the open source community in adopting fuzz testing, or fuzzing — an automated code testing technique for uncovering bugs in software. In addition to the OSS-Fuzz service, which provides a free platform for continuous fuzzing to critical open source projects, we established an OSS-Fuzz Reward Program in 2017 as part of our wider Patch Rewards Program. \nWe’ve ope…",

Sometimes that’s true, but sometimes the project is merely finished, and that’s okay. In fact, it’s better than okay. It’s downright successful.\nThere’s a big difference between quitting and finishing. Quitting is in the realm of failure, but finishing is in the realm of success.

I wanted to give them control over their data and to be able to store it locally to open and edit later. And also easily share it with other people. It’s easy to do this by supporting file upload/download, but I wanted something simpler, like the ability to share by sending a url. I also didn’t want to store anything on the backend (at least for the free tier).\nWhat he decided on was to base64 encode the entire application state and store it in the fragment section of the URL. I love all the upsides of this approach and it’s pretty trivial to accomplish. Here’s the pseudocode that Scott provides in his post:\nconst stateString = JSON.stringify(appState); // appState is a json object\nconst compressed = compress(stateString);\nconst encoded = Base64.encode(compressed);\n// Push that `encoded` string to the url\n// ... Later, on page load or on undo/redo we read the url and\n// do the following\nconst decoded = Base64.decode(encoded); // same encoded as above, but read from url\nconst uncompressed = uncompress(decoded);\nconst newState = JSON.parse(uncompressed);\n// Now load your application with the newState\n\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
