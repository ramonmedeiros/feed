          "description": "Amy Ressler, Chrome Security Team on behalf of the Chrome VRP\n\n\n\nFor 13 years, a key pillar of the Chrome Security ecosystem has included encouraging security researchers to find security vulnerabilities in Chrome browser and report them to us, through the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program.\n\n\nStarting today and until 1 December 2023, the first security bug report we receive with a functional full chain exploit, resulting in a Chrome sandbox escape, is eligible for triple the full reward amount. Your full chain exploit could result in a reward up to $180,000 (potentially more with other bonuses).\n\n\n \n\n\nAny subsequent full chains submitted during this time are eligible for double the full reward amount! \n\n\nWe have historically put a premium on reports with exploits –  “high quality report…",

          "description": "Posted by Ashish Pujari, Chrome Security Team\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nChrome is trusted by millions of business users as a secure enterprise browser. Organizations can use Chrome Browser Cloud Management to help manage Chrome browsers more effectively. As an admin, they can use the Google Admin console to get Chrome to report critical security events to third-party service providers such as Splunk® to create custom enterprise security remediation workflows.\n\n\nSecurity remediation is the process of responding to security events that have been triggered by a system or a user. Remediation can be done manually or automatically, and it is an important part of an enterprise security program.\n\n\nWhy is Automated Security Remediation Important?\n\n\nWhen a security event is identified, it is imperative to re…",
