As an open source framework designed to improve the integrity of software packages and infrastructure, it is as applicable to small open source projects as to enterprise organizations. But with this flexibility can come a bewildering array of options for beginners—much like salsa dancing, someone just starting out might be left on the dance floor wondering how and where to jump in.\nThough it’s tempting to try to establish a single standard for how to use SLSA, it’s not possible: SLSA is not a line dance where everyone does the same moves, at the same time, to the same song.

Lately, I’ve come to ponder that there might be a fruitful expansion to this argument, that we should start to value principles over patterns, patterns over libraries, and libraries over frameworks.\nI don’t disagree!\nThe challenge with principles & patterns is they are more difficult to formalize (and communicate) than libraries & frameworks because they’re by nature less specific and more meta (lowercase “m” ftw).\nIn other words, libraries & frameworks are an end product. Principles & patterns are means to an end. It’s easier to ship a product than to ship the means to it.\nThe latter is the realm of documentation, education, and conversation.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

In keeping with this, our architecture is a standard CRUD app architecture, a Python monolith on top of Postgres. Starting with a simple architecture and solving problems in simple ways where possible has allowed us to scale to this size while engineers mostly focus on work that delivers value to users.\nDespite the unreasonable effectiveness of simple architectures, most press goes to complex architectures. For example, at a recent generalist tech conference, there were six talks on how to build or deal with side effects of complex, microservice-based, architectures and zero how one might build out a simple monolith… Larger conferences are similar; a recent enterprise-oriented conference in SF had a double digit number of talks on dealing with the complexity of a sophisticated architecture and zero on how to build a simple monolith.\nHe goes on to describe boring choices they’ve made and  counter-balances that some by also describing why they’ve made some more complex choices such as GraphQL and Kubernetes. An excellent, nuanced piece.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

This allows GUI tools to be used on remote SQLite databases which can make administration easier.\nThe proxy works by translating Postgres frontend wire messages into SQLite transactions and converting results back into Postgres response wire messages. Many Postgres clients also inspect the pg_catalog to determine system information so Postlite mirrors this catalog by using an attached in-memory database with virtual tables. The proxy also performs minor rewriting on these system queries to convert them to usable SQLite syntax.\nIt appears that Ben is taking code contributions this time around, but only for bug & documentation fixes.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

To demonstrate, imagine you have a users table that tracks when a user is online. You might add a status column which can have one of two values: online and offline. How would you track how long a user is online for throughout an entire month? An auditing system would track every change with timestamps, and so you can measure the difference between each timestamp and sum them up for the entire month.\nWhat really impresses me about the Supabase team is how much they’re leaning in to Postgres’ rich feature set to build high-quality-yet-low-level abstractions for their users. Paul Copplestone emphasized this when we had him on the show back in January.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Toby and the team at Charm have gone “all in” on Go — all of Charm is written in Go. They moved to Go from other languages, saying “Go is the answer to building these type of tools.” And even on this episode Toby says “I love Rust, it’s really cool, it’s a super-exciting language, but I jumped ship. I wanna be more productive, I wanna use all the fun toys, and so I started doing Go.” Clearly this episode will be in good company here on Go Time.\nWe talk about the state of the art, the next big thing happening on the command line and in ssh-land.

We call them “Scripts to Rule Them All”.\nHere’s a mapping of what these scripts are named and their responsibility:\nscript/bootstrap – installs/updates all dependencies\nscript/setup – sets up a project to be used for the first time\nscript/update – updates a project to run at its current version\nscript/server – starts app\nscript/test – runs tests\nscript/cibuild – invoked by continuous integration servers to run tests\nscript/console – opens a console\nEach of these scripts are responsible for a unit of work.
