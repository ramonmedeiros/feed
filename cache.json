It‚Äôs easy to do this by supporting file upload/download, but I wanted something simpler, like the ability to share by sending a url. I also didn‚Äôt want to store anything on the backend (at least for the free tier).\nWhat he decided on was to base64 encode the entire application state and store it in the fragment section of the URL. I love all the upsides of this approach and it‚Äôs pretty trivial to accomplish. Here‚Äôs the pseudocode that Scott provides in his post:\nconst stateString = JSON.stringify(appState); // appState is a json object\nconst compressed = compress(stateString);\nconst encoded = Base64.encode(compressed);\n// Push that `encoded` string to the url\n// ... Later, on page load or on undo/redo we read the url and\n// do the following\nconst decoded = Base64.decode(encoded); // same encoded as above, but read from url\nconst uncompressed = uncompress(decoded);\nconst newState = JSON.parse(uncompressed);\n// Now load your application with the newState\n\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

His position was always that services should be named something descriptive, so that you can infer from the name what it does. My position is that the name should definitely not be descriptive, but should be something cute and wholly disconnected from the purpose. And I think this applies more broadly to projects and companies, too.\nNicholas‚Äô reason for cute names winning comes down to the inevitably of change in a service/project‚Äôs function and the difficulty in renaming things. I hadn‚Äôt thought of that argument, but I already agreed with the premise.\nWe also apply this thinking to podcast episode names, which can be a mixed bag because descriptive titles certainly help when it comes to discovery. As Adam and I discussed on our recent State of the ‚Äúlog‚Äù episode, if you see use a descriptive title, it‚Äôs most likely because we couldn‚Äôt think of a good cute/interesting one.\nBut that‚Äôs just our opinion about episode naming.
