In this post we cover details on how passkeys stored in the Google Password Manager are kept secure. See our post on the Android Developers Blog for a more general overview.\nPasskeys are a safer and more secure alternative to passwords. They also replace the need for traditional 2nd factor authentication methods such as text message, app based one-time codes or push-based approvals. Passkeys use public-key cryptography so that data breaches of service providers don't result in a compromise of passkey-protected accounts, and are based on industry standard APIs and protocols to ensure they are not su‚Ä¶",

One person is responsible (Ash Furrow) and they‚Äôve hit their limit personally and technically.\nA member of my family was very recently diagnosed with a terminal illness. I am doing everything I can to support them.\nLast week, with yet more Elon Musk and Twitter news, the fediverse generally experienced extra traffic with an influx of new users. I woke up to mastodon.technology downtime alerts. In the midst of supporting my family, I had to ssh into a server and fiddle with settings.\nI am exhausted.\nThe server has also gotten too large and too complex for me to administer. I‚Äôve always been keen to learn the next new skill I need to be an effective admin. But I just don‚Äôt have it in me anymore. The monitoring that I have in place is insufficient to solve the current problems and I have zero bandwidth to invest in learning the skills to diagnose and fix the issue.\nAges ago (4 years) we talked with Eugen Rochko on The Changelog (the creator of Mastodon) about the ‚Äúabsolute freedom in how people can run their servers,‚Äù  and how the ‚Äúincentives are usually ideological‚Äù when running a Mastodon server.\nYes, we talked about the costs of running a server, but from my recollection that seemed to be purely from a monetary perspective.

Also disregard the fact that I had other highly-rated apps up on the App Store, some of which had been updated much more recently than July 2019, clearly showing that I have not abandoned these apps entirely. If there had been an actual reviewer who checked my outdated app, they would have discovered that I architected the app from the beginning to dynamically scale the UI so it resizes to fit the latest iPhone devices. All these could be signals that indicate to Apple that this is not a garbage-filled scam app that is lowering the quality of their App Store.\nShe goes on to tell the entire saga that she (and others) were put through to keep their apps on the store.

We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.\nWe might need to give this a spin on our transcripts.
