          "description": "Posted by Jonathan Metzman, Google Open Source Security Team\n\n\nIn recent years, continuous fuzzing has become an essential part of the software development lifecycle. By feeding unexpected or random data into a program, fuzzing catches bugs that would otherwise slip through the most thorough manual checks and provides coverage that would take staggering human effort to replicate. NIST’s guidelines for software verification, recently released in response to the White House Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, specify fuzzing among the minimum standard requirements for code verification.\nToday, we are excited to announce ClusterFuzzLite, a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before.

Objects tell for how to work with them, and the for loop’s body processes what’s given back by the object. Ruby does the opposite. In Ruby, for itself (via each) is a method of the Object. The caller passes the body of the for loop to this method.\nHe goes on to give examples and explain why each approach might map to different developers’ brains… differently.

          "description": "Avdi Grimm kicks off a new series of posts (that I’m quite excited about) on the various parts that go into a “banana stand” business by deftly wielding a classic Arrested Development gag and telling the tale of how he got his stand started:\nI’m a software developer by trade. I’ve slung code either as an employee or as an independent consultant for over two decades. But around ten years ago, I started selling e-books about programming. At the time it was a way to recoup the time and energy I had sunk into researching conference talks, as well as a way to expand on the topics of those talks.\nE-books expanded to screencasts, and then to courses. I found myself with a diversified product income that sometimes rivaled or even exceeded what I could expect from a developer’s salary.\nAs a result, gaps between gigs haven’t felt like “unemployment” for a long time. Instead, they are opportunities to work on my education business. Recently, a major gig I’d been looking forward to fell through at the last second. Once I worked through the disappointment, I was like: “welp, there’s always money in the banana stand!”\nThe first component of your banana stand: a mailing list\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Of course there are servers hard at work handling your application’s requests, but that’s our problem, not yours. We do all the hard work behind the scenes of allocating, configuring, and maintaining the servers. Instead of paying for servers, you pay for the requests that your application makes to the database and the storage that your data consumes.\nHow they got here:\nBefore now, a single physical CockroachDB cluster was intended for dedicated use by a single user or organization. That is called single-tenancy. Over the past several CockroachDB releases, we’ve quietly been adding multi-tenancy support…\nHow they scale it:\nWithin every Serverless cluster, there is an autoscaler component that is responsible for determining the ideal number of SQL pods that should be assigned to each tenant, whether that be one, many, or zero.\nAnd what it all means for Cockroach’s users.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Its easy-to-use and well-documented drivers make MongoDB one of the easiest to use database solutions available. However, MongoDB abandoned its open-source roots, changing the license to SSPL - making it unusable for many open source and commercial projects.\nMost MongoDB users are not in need of many of the advanced features offered by MongoDB; however, they are in need of an open-source database solution. Recognizing this, MangoDB is here to fill the gap by providing an alternative.\nThis is currently a proof of concept.

          "description": "This post by Pat Shaugnessy echoes Matt Rickard’s sentiment that we discussed in-depth on The Changelog 463:\nThe best way to learn a new programming language, just like a human language, is from example. To learn how to write code you first need to read someone else’s code. But who is the best person to learn from? Which code should we read? Where should we look to find it?\nPat was looking into Crystal and found its standard library to be excellent reading. I think his conclusion generalizes pretty well, with caveats.\nOlder languages often have areas of the standard library that were written prior to new language features, so they are no longer idiomatic.\nSome standard library code is necessarily low-level, even dipping into the underlying language or using esoteric features. This can make for some tough sledding.\nStandard library code is used so frequently that it’s often highly optimized for performance, which reduces readability.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
