Similar to shellshock and heartbleed, Log4Shell is just the latest catastrophic vulnerability in software that runs the internet. Our mission as the Google Open Source Security Team is to secure the open source libraries the world depends on, such as Log4j. One of our capabilities in this space is OSS-Fuzz, a free fuzzing service that is used by over 500 critical open source projects and has found more than 7,000 vulnerabilities in its lifetime. \nWe want to empower open source developers to secure their code on their own. Over the next year we will work on better automated detection of non-memory corruption vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell. We have star…",

Here’s the opening pitch:\nWe know there are huge costs and risks in introducing a new main language in the kernel. We risk dividing efforts and we increase the knowledge required to contribute to some parts of the kernel.\nMost importantly, any new language introduced means any module written in that language will be way harder to replace later on if the support for the new language gets dropped.\nNevertheless, we believe that, even today, the advantages of using Rust outweighs the cost. We will explain why in the following sections.\nGodspeed to everyone collaborating on what will surely be a massive, years-long undertaking.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

The more facility you gain with first-principle reasoning and napkin math, the closer I’d wager you’ll inch towards this conclusion as well.

But as issues evolve and new precedents are set, finding the right information to defend a particular case can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.\nFor example, a human rights advocate campaigning for LGBTQ rights may want to know which countries have made the most progress and what resolutions they’ve passed. To do so, they have to manually sift through thousands of pages of dense documentation covering global laws and victims’ testimonies to find what they’re looking for.\nThe curation and cataloging of documents makes this process much easier, but still relies on the manual work of skilled experts.

And when it comes to other types of information beyond words, in many ways, technology hasn’t even begun to scratch the surface of what’s possible. Take one example: sign language.\nThe task is daunting. There are as many sign languages as there are spoken languages around the world. That’s why, when we started exploring how we could better support sign language, we started small by researching and experimenting with what machine learning models could recognize.
