          "description": "Posted by¬†Laurent Simon and Azeem Shaikh, Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST)¬†\n\n\n\nSince our July announcement of Scorecards V2, the Scorecards project‚Äîan automated security tool to flag risky supply chain practices in open source projects‚Äîhas grown steadily to over 40 unique contributors and 18 implemented security checks. Today we are proud to announce the V4 release of Scorecards, with larger scaling, a new security check, and a new Scorecards GitHub Action for easier security automation.\nThe Scorecards Action is released in partnership with GitHub and is available from GitHub's Marketplace. The Action makes using Scorecards easier than ever: it runs automatically on repository changes to alert developers about risky supply-chain practices. Maintainers can view the alerts on GitHub's code scanning dashboard, which is available for free to public repositories on GitHub.com and via GitHub Advanced Security for private repositories. \nAdditionally, we have scaled our weekly Scorecards scans to over one million GitHub repositories, and have partnered with the Open Source Insights website for easy user access to the data. \nFor more details about the release, including the new Dangerous-Workflow security check, visit the OpenSSF's official blog post here.",

Maintenance is what we‚Äôre really talking about. When parts on our car or bicycle suffers wear from driving them around, we don‚Äôt talk to our mechanic about ‚Äúmechanical debt‚Äù. (Go back and re-read that sentence, but replace things with ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù and ‚Äúprogrammers‚Äù). We talk about maintenance.\nThis post starts as mostly a semantic debate, and I‚Äôm not convinced by his arguments there. I think the debt metaphor is useful when you‚Äôre talking about trading quality for speed. That‚Äôs what you do when you take on debt: you trade higher cost at a future date (principle + interest) to gain access to the money today (speed).\nThat being said, I really like where Jesse ends this piece talking about software maintenance and methods of going about it. Lots of actionable advice there and I‚Äôm 100% onboard with talking about software maintenance early and often. One of the first things I consider when somebody approaches me with a feature idea is ask myself: what will this cost to maintain?\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
