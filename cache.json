Building AI securely is a paramount concern, and we believe that Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) can help chart a path for creating AI applications that users can trust. Today, we’re highlighting two new ways to make information about AI supply chain security universally discoverable and verifiable, so that AI can be created and used responsibly. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first principle of SAIF is to ensure that the AI ecosystem has strong security foundations. In particular, the software supply chains for components specific to AI development, such as machine learning models, need to be secured against threats i…",

Most of the components we mentioned then were system services in userspace (running under Linux), but these are not the only components typically written in memory-unsafe languages. Many security-critical components of an Android system run in a “bare-metal” environment, outside of the Linux kernel, and these are historically written in C. As part of our efforts to harden firmware on Android devices, we are increasingly using Rust in these bare-metal environments too.\n\n\nTo that end, we have rewritten the Android Virtualization Framework’s protected VM (pVM) firmware in Rust to provide a memory safe foundation for the pVM root of trust.

For the first time, security researchers could get bounties for n-day exploits even if they didn’t find the vulnerability themselves. This format proved valuable in improving our understanding of the most widely exploited parts of the linux kernel. Its success motivated us to expand it to new areas and we're now excited to announce that we're extending it to two new targets: v8CTF and kvmCTF.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we're launching v8CTF, a CTF focused on V8, the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome. kvmCTF is an upcoming CTF focused on Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) that will be released later in the year.…",
