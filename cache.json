Here‚Äôs an example analogy of Feet and Segways:\nFirst, there was walking. Then the Segway came to CHANGE THE NATURE OF HUMAN TRANSPORT. Twenty years later, there is still walking, plus occasionally low-key alternatives like electric scooters.\nIn this analogy, LLMs work fine but just aren‚Äôt worth the trouble in most cases and society doesn‚Äôt evolve to integrate them.

It‚Äôs essentially a small language you write in the class attributes of your HTML that compiles to a combination of CSS rules and selectors ‚Äî an abstraction over CSS. But all abstractions leak, and Tailwind is very leaky.\nWhen an abstraction leaks, it means you still have to be aware of (and sometimes deeply so) the underlying layer that‚Äôs being abstracted. In this case, Jake is saying that you still need to know CSS to use Tailwind and lays out a few scenarios in which this is the case.\nThis might be unfair to Tailwind. To my knowledge, the team has never promoted it as a CSS replacement. At its core, it really is just a set of class names that apply styles.

It kind of depends on the project.\nToday I‚Äôm taking this one step further, and I‚Äôm introducing a new concept: extremely linear git history.\nWith our extremely linear history, the first commit in a repo hash a hash that starts with 0000000, the second commit is 0000001, the third is 0000002, and so on!\nHow he accomplishes this is perhaps even more interesting (and hacky!)\n\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Well, Retool (a Changelog sponsor) can consider themselves flattered, because Openblocks sets out to do openly what they‚Äôve been doing proprietarily. Here‚Äôs why:\nIt‚Äôs cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.\nLow-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.\nRetool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.\nOpenblocks wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Openblocks is\nAn all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.\nA place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.\nA domain-specific language that UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
