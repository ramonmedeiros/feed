          "description": "Posted by Oliver Chang, Dongge Liu and Jonathan Metzman, Google Open Source Security Team\n\n\nRecently, OSS-Fuzz reported 26 new vulnerabilities to open source project maintainers, including one vulnerability in the critical OpenSSL library (CVE-2024-9143) that underpins much of internet infrastructure. The reports themselves aren’t unusual—we’ve reported and helped maintainers fix over 11,000 vulnerabilities in the 8 years of the project. \n\n\n\nBut these particular vulnerabilities represent a milestone for automated vulnerability finding: each was found with AI, using AI-generated and enhanced fuzz targets. The OpenSSL CVE is one of the first vulnerabilities in a critical piece of software that was discovered by LLMs, adding another real-world example to a recent Google discovery of an exploi…",
