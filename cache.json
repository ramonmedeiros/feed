          "description": "Posted by Ard Biesheuvel, Google Open Source Security Team¬†\n\nLinux kernel support for the 32-bit ARM architecture was contributed in the late 90s, when there was little corporate involvement in Linux development, and most contributors were students or hobbyists, tinkering with development boards, often without much in the way of documentation.\n\n\nNow 20+ years later, 32-bit ARM's maintainer has downgraded its support level to 'odd fixes,' while remaining active as a kernel contributor. This is a common pattern for aging and obsolete architectures: corporate funding for Linux kernel development has tremendously increased the pace of development, but only for architectures with a high return on investment. As a result, the 32-bit ARM port of Linux is essentially in maintenance-only mode, and ‚Ä¶",

After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.\nToday, I want to explore why that‚Äôs nonsense. Let‚Äôs dig in!\nI built one of the first big SPAs (remember Grooveshark?), but I‚Äôve shied away from them ever since. I do think there are cases when they make sense (Trello and GMail come to mind), but overall I think too many people chose the architecture too many times because it was the it thing to do vs it was actually the best decision for their circumstance.\nHeck, even Chris‚Äôs disclaimer of ‚Äòwhen SPAs make sense‚Äô section at the top is easily defeated by our Turbolinks implementation. But I digress‚Ä¶ read this post it‚Äôs a good one for sure.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

          "description": "Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.\nIt has an S3-compatible API and can be used as a storage backend for things like NextCloud, Matrix, and Mastodon. It‚Äôs being built by a non-profit in France that is ‚Äúworking to promote self-hosting and small-scale hosting.‚Äù Why do they do this?\nself-hosting means running our own hardware at home, and providing 24/7 Internet services from there. We have many reasons for doing this. One is because this is the only way we can truly control who has access to our data. Another one is that it helps us be aware of the physical substrate of which the Internet is made: making the Internet run has an environmental cost which we want to evaluate and keep under control. The physical hardware also gives us a sense of community, calling to mind all of the people that could currently be connected and making use of our services, and reminding us of the purpose for which we are doing this.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
