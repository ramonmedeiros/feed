In addition to existing support for DNS-over-TLS, Android now supports   DNS-over-HTTP/3 which has a number of improvements over DNS-over-TLS. \n  Most network connections begin with a DNS lookup. While transport security may   be applied to the connection itself, that DNS lookup has traditionally not   been private by default: the base DNS protocol is raw UDP with no encryption.   While the internet has migrated to TLS over time, DNS has a bootstrapping   problem. Certificate verification relies on the domain of the other party,   which requires either DNS itself, or moves the problem to DHCP (which may be   maliciously controlled). This issue is mitigate…",

Additionally, I’ll discuss areas where the Elixir ecosystem still comes up short, and using Nx for a new project might not be the best idea.\nSean is a prominent member of the Elixir community, so that’s the perspective on display here, but it’s a thorough and well-reasoned comparison. He concludes:\nWhile there are still many gaps in the Elixir ecosystem, the progress over the last year has been rapid.

Lets you test if a value is definitely NOT in a list of pre-stored values (or POSSIBLY in a list - with adjustable probability that influences storage of the values.)\nGood use-case: routing. Say you have a list of 1 million IPs that are black listed. A trivial algorithm would be to compare every element of the set with a given IP. The time complexity grows with the number of elements. Not so with a bloom filter! A bloom filter is one of the few data structures whose time complexity does not grow with the number of elements due to the ‘keys’ not needing to be stored (‘search’ and ‘insert’ is based on the number of hash functions.)\nThe responses are numerous with a lot of signal, which is increasingly rare on the orange website these days.

Most of them have looked something like what the author describes:\nthe technique has some major downsides. The first is that soft deletion logic bleeds out into all parts of your code. All our selects look something like this:\nSELECT *\nFROM customer\nWHERE id = @id\n    AND deleted_at IS NULL;\n\nAnd forgetting that extra predicate on deleted_at can have dangerous consequences as it accidentally returns data that’s no longer meant to be seen.\nORMs help with this, but not enough. You set it as a default scope and then there’s that one time where you also want the deleted records so you come up with a custom query or dig into your ORM and try to find how to bypass the rule. Yuck!\nHe goes on to describe other problems as well. Maybe it’s all a big case of YAGNI?\nOnce again, soft deletion is theoretically a hedge against accidental data loss. As a last argument against it, I’d ask you to consider, realistically, whether undeletion is something that’s ever actually done.\nWhen I worked at Heroku, we used soft deletion.\nWhen I worked at Stripe, we used soft deletion.\nAt my job right now, we use soft deletion.\nAs far as I’m aware, never once, in ten plus years, did anyone at any of these places ever actually use soft deletion to undelete something.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

The question is - what happens with the code once it is generated? Who is responsible for it and who will maintain and refactor it in the future?\nAlthough ML code generation helps with getting the initial code written, it cannot do much beyond that - if that code is to be maintained and changed in the future … the developer still needs to fully own and understand it.\nGenerated code accepted blindly is creating tech debt!\nIn other words, it means Copilot and similar solutions do not reduce the code complexity nor the amount of knowledge required to build features, they just help write the initial code faster, and bring the knowledge/examples closer to the code (which is really helpful). If a developer accepts the generated code blindly, they are just creating tech debt and pushing it forward.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
