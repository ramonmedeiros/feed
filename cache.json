Over the past year, we‚Äôve been excited to see more focused activity across policymakers, industry partners, developers, and public interest advocates around raising the security and transparency bar for IoT products.  \nThat said, the details of IoT product labeling - the definition of labeling, what labeling needs to convey in terms of security and privacy, where the label should reside, and how to achieve consumer acceptance, are still open for debate.  Google has also been considering these core questions for a long time.  As an operating system, IoT product provider, and the maint‚Ä¶",

You may have to answer that question for yourself, but this post shares some good thoughts around designing a modular monolith:\nWhen designing a modular monolith, it is all about breaking up the system into modules, and then combining those modules into a monolith for deployment.\nIt might be worth noting that finding what modules you will need, might not be as easy as you would think. They have to be as independent as possible. High-cohesion and low coupling is very important here, as all communication between the modules might end up being a cross network call, if you decide to break it into services in the future.\nThis means that all communication between modules need to well abstracted, and be either asynchronous, so that they can handle the call going across the network in the future, or use some form of messaging.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

On large applications, it shows updates 10x faster than Vite and 700x faster than Webpack. On even larger applications, the difference is greater‚Äîoften 20x faster than Vite.\nTurbopack is open source and still in alpha. Here‚Äôs what the future may hold:\nTo start, Turbopack will be used for the Next.js 13 development server. It will power lightning-fast HMR, and it will support React Server Components natively, as well as TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more.\nTurbopack will eventually also power Next.js production builds, both locally and in the cloud. We‚Äôll be able to share Turbo‚Äôs cache across your entire team, using Vercel Remote Caching.\nWebpack users can also expect an incremental migration path into the Rust-based future with Turbopack.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

And if you‚Äôre going to read just one review, it might as well be Ars Technica‚Äôs‚Ä¶\nI haven‚Äôt waded into the depth of this review yet, but the opener has me underwhelmed:\nThe throughline for all these features is about making the Mac more welcoming and comfortable for people who come to it through one of Apple‚Äôs mobile platforms‚Ä¶\nBut when was the last time that the Finder, the Dock, or the Menu Bar was given a substantial, non-cosmetic rethink? When did Apple last make major improvements to the way that windows coexist on a given screen? The Mac does get new under-the-hood features that are specific to it, but the headline features are mostly iOS and iPadOS imports, especially this year.\nI would absolutely love for Apple to rethink Finder! Having said that, the fact that this reviewer is down with Stage Manager on macOS despite how terrible I‚Äôve heard it is on iOS is intriguing‚Ä¶\nStage Manager differs from standard macOS multitasking by offering a column of recently used apps on the side of your screen (it‚Äôs the left-hand side by default, but it will switch if you‚Äôve got your Dock set to use the left-hand side of your screen instead). But unlike minimizing or maximizing an app from the Dock, each ‚Äústage‚Äù can contain multiple app windows from multiple apps; switch from one stage to another, and every window on that stage will pop back up on your screen in exactly the arrangement you were using before.\nIt‚Äôs off by default, thank goodness, but I would like to give this a try and see how it maps to my way of window/app management. Have you tried Stage Manager on macOS? What do you think? How does it compare to iOS?\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

But it really isn‚Äôt any of those things, not if you‚Äôre actually trying to put it to practice.

Another major category is good opportunities.\nWhen you‚Äôre first getting started in your career, you are short on opportunities and long on time. But success breeds success. At a certain point, that relationship flips and you have more opportunities (actual, good ones) than you have time.

As SVP of Technology and Society, part of my work at Google is connecting people and ideas to help shape the future of our most ambitious technology and its impact on society, and to do it responsibly.\n\n\nAn important part of that is talking to and learning from experts in a variety of fields and disciplines. Recently I sat down with a brilliant friend, New York Times columnist and author Thomas L. Friedman, to compare notes and discuss some big questions on our minds.\n\n\n\n\nThomas Friedman and James Manyika in conversation at Google‚Äôs Bay View campus.\n\n\n\nWe had a lot to cover, as it had been a couple of years since our last such in-person conversation due to the pandemic. Much of our discussion focused on AI and how it affects society, but we also discussed what Tom has been observing, how we as a society shape technology, and why we think this moment in time is an inflection point akin to the printing press or the industrial revolution.\n\n\nTo close our conversation, I asked Tom what keeps him optimistic about the future. His answer reinforces my belief that getting technology right is a collective responsibility involving the whole of society ‚Äî from open, honest conversations like this to better understand the opportunities and challenges, to defining policy, and responsibly creating new and societally-beneficial applications.\n\n\nI always learn something new when I have these conversations with Tom, and I‚Äôm excited to share more insights and dialogues on YouTube soon.\n\n\nVisit YouTubeto see more of James‚Äô conversation with Thomas Friedman.",
