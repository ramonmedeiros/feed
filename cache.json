          "description": "Posted by Oliver Chang and Andrew Pollock, Google Open Source Security Team \nIt is an interesting time for everyone concerned with open source vulnerabilities. The U.S. Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity requirements for vulnerability disclosure programs and assurances for software used by the US government will go into effect later this year. Finding and fixing security vulnerabilities has never been more important, yet with increasing interest in the area, the vulnerability management space has become fragmented—there are a lot of new tools and competing standards. \nIn 2021, we announced the launch of OSV, a database of open source vulnerabilities built partially from vulnerabilities found through Google’s OSS-Fuzz program. OSV has grown since then and now includes a…",

To date, it has performed more than 80 million cleanups, helping to pave the way for a cleaner, safer web. \nA changing landscape\n  \nIn recent years, several factors have led us to reevaluate the need for this application to keep Chrome users on Windows safe.  \nFirst, the user perspective – Chrome user complaints about UwS have continued to fall over the years, averaging out to around 3% of total complaints in…",

Writing’s the hard part. We often bike shed the easy parts to avoid the hard part. Yuri seems to agree:\nHaving the right tool certainly helps, but at the end of the day, what matters is what you write there.

This is best illustrated by an anecdote that I first heard from Kevin Cannon at PUSH Conference: a potter who spends time making 100 vases will end up with one that’s better quality than if they spent the same amount of time trying to just make 1 perfect vase. So, while quality is obviously important, focussing on quantity at the start of a creative journey is the way to get there.\nI’ve never heard that anecdote before, but I absolutely love the truth it so clearly represents.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
