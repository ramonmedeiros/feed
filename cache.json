The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to perform remote code execution by exploiting the insecure JNDI lookups feature exposed by the logging library log4j. This exploitable feature was enabled by default in many versions of the library.\n\n\nThis vulnerability has captivated the information security ecosystem since its disclosure on December 9th because of both its severity and widespread impact.

Hopefully, after reading this post you‚Äôll have a better understanding of what generics can do for you and what they can‚Äôt.\nMark shares lots of good tips along the way. His findings are quite positive:\nI ‚ù§Ô∏è that I was able to delete 95% of my code because of generics.\nI think that generics will be very beneficial to maintainers who create libraries for things like my own as well as for searching, sorting, transformations, and the like. I can also see some them being extremely helpful for creating well-tested libraries around the various concurrency patterns that are sometimes tricky to get right.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",
