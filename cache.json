          "description": "Posted by Laurent Simon and Azeem Shaikh, Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST) \n\n\n\nSince our July announcement of Scorecards V2, the Scorecards project—an automated security tool to flag risky supply chain practices in open source projects—has grown steadily to over 40 unique contributors and 18 implemented security checks. Today we are proud to announce the V4 release of Scorecards, with larger scaling, a new security check, and a new Scorecards GitHub Action for easier security automation.\nThe Scorecards Action is released in partnership with GitHub and is available from GitHub's Marketplace. The Action makes using Scorecards easier than ever: it runs automatically on repository changes to alert developers about risky supply-chain practices. Maintainers can view the alerts on GitHub's code scanning dashboard, which is available for free to public repositories on GitHub.com and via GitHub Advanced Security for private repositories. \nAdditionally, we have scaled our weekly Scorecards scans to over one million GitHub repositories, and have partnered with the Open Source Insights website for easy user access to the data. \nFor more details about the release, including the new Dangerous-Workflow security check, visit the OpenSSF's official blog post here.",

          "description": "Jesse O’Brien from Test Double wants us to stop using the term “Tech Debt”\nThere’s loads of reasons why unmaintainable code ends up running in the systems our products are built on, but none of these fit the definition of debt.\nInstead, I propose we drop the term Tech Debt and start talking about maintenance tasks. Maintenance is what we’re really talking about. When parts on our car or bicycle suffers wear from driving them around, we don’t talk to our mechanic about “mechanical debt”. (Go back and re-read that sentence, but replace things with “software” and “programmers”). We talk about maintenance.\nThis post starts as mostly a semantic debate, and I’m not convinced by his arguments there. I think the debt metaphor is useful when you’re talking about trading quality for speed. That’s what you do when you take on debt: you trade higher cost at a future date (principle + interest) to gain access to the money today (speed).\nThat being said, I really like where Jesse ends this piece talking about software maintenance and methods of going about it. Lots of actionable advice there and I’m 100% onboard with talking about software maintenance early and often. One of the first things I consider when somebody approaches me with a feature idea is ask myself: what will this cost to maintain?\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

Its unique feature is that it is protocol-compatible with Apple AirDrop which allows to share files with Apple devices running iOS and macOS.\nSuper cool, but with a disclaimer: this is the result of reverse engineering the transfer protocol, so the odds of it being flakey (especially as Apple ships OS updates) are high. It’d be rad if Apple would publish an AirDrop-compatible specification for the community to rally around.\nYou know, like they did with FaceTime. 😉\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

For example, healthcare providers are increasingly using genome sequencing to diagnose rare genetic diseases, such as elevated risk for breast cancer or pulmonary arterial hypertension, which are estimated to affect roughly 8% of the population.\nAt Google Health, we’re applying our technology and expertise to the field of genomics. Here are recent research and industry developments we’ve made to help quickly identify genetic disease and foster the equity of genomic tests across ancestries. This includes an exciting new partnership with Pacific Biosciences to further advance genomic technologies in research and the clinic.\n\n\nHelping identify life-threatening disease when minutes matter\nGenetic diseases can cause cr…",
