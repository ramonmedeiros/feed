          "description": "Tianhao Chi and Puneet Sood, Google Public DNS\n\n\n\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental protocol used on the Internet to translate human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into numeric IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1) so that devices and servers can find and communicate with each other. When a user enters a domain name in their browser, the DNS resolver (e.g. Google Public DNS) locates the authoritative DNS nameservers for the requested name, and queries one or more of them to obtain the IP address(es) to return to the browser.\nWhen DNS was launched in the early 1980s as a trusted, content-neutral infrastructure, security was not yet a pressing concern, however, as the Internet grew DNS became vulnerable to various attacks. In this post, we will look at DNS cache poisonin‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Posted by Eugene Rodionov and Ivan Lozano, Android Team\n\n\nWith steady improvements to Android userspace and kernel security, we have noticed an increasing interest from security researchers directed towards lower level firmware. This area has traditionally received less scrutiny, but is critical to device security. We have previously discussed how we have been prioritizing firmware security, and how to apply mitigations in a firmware environment to mitigate unknown vulnerabilities.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn this post we will show how the Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASan) can be used to proactively discover vulnerabilities earlier in the development lifecycle. Despite the narrow application implied by its name, KASan is applicable to a wide-range of firmware targets. Using KASan enabled builds during testing‚Ä¶",
