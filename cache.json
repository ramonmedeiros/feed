          "description": "Posted by Michael Spaulding, Senior Product Manager, Ad Traffic Quality\n\n\n\nConnected TV (CTV) has not only transformed the entertainment world, it has also created a vibrant new platform for digital advertising. However, as with any innovative space, there are challenges that arise, including the emergence of bad actors aiming to siphon money away from advertisers and publishers through fraudulent or invalid ad traffic. Invalid traffic is an evolving challenge that has the potential to affect the integrity and health of digital advertising on CTV. However, there are steps the industry can take to combat invalid traffic and foster a clean, trustworthy, and sustainable ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation sharing and following best practices\nEvery player across the digital advertising ecosystem has …",

And the AP is one of many such processors of a System On Chip (SoC). Other processors on the SoC perform various specialized tasks — such as security functions, image & video processing, and most importantly cellular communications. The processor performing cellular communications is often referred to as the baseband. For the purposes of this blog, we refer to the software that runs on all these other processors as “Firmware”.  \nSecuring the Android Platform requires going beyond the confines of the Application Processor (AP).

And by the end of the six month contract, Zed Industries and I may decide to part ways and still be friends.\nAnd I am blogging about my experience so far.

I was quite happy to delete the 500 lines of Ansible scripts, systemd unit files, and Caddy config files.\nIt also made me smile to finally stop the EC2 instance and bump my AWS bill down from $9 per month to about 10 cents per month (I still use S3 for user-uploaded images and for backups).

Having your own platform enables flexibility and portability, so your content can be kept online practically forever.\nThis!\nThere are many options out there, ranging from WordPress and Ghost to static blogs to managed online platforms and Micro.blog. How do you choose between them?\nWhat follows is a survey of some of the popular tools and what Yury thinks about them. My advice is this: don’t worry too much about tooling. That’s the easy part. Writing’s the hard part. We often bike shed the easy parts to avoid the hard part. Yuri seems to agree:\nHaving the right tool certainly helps, but at the end of the day, what matters is what you write there.

          "description": "In a post about overestimating our short-term ability and underestimate our long-term ability, Paavan drops this nugget:\nIt’s important to recognise the value of quantity over quality. This is best illustrated by an anecdote that I first heard from Kevin Cannon at PUSH Conference: a potter who spends time making 100 vases will end up with one that’s better quality than if they spent the same amount of time trying to just make 1 perfect vase. So, while quality is obviously important, focussing on quantity at the start of a creative journey is the way to get there.\nI’ve never heard that anecdote before, but I absolutely love the truth it so clearly represents.\nDiscuss on Changelog News",

As a result, users experience terrible UX, slow loading times, and a lack of interactivity until everything is rendered. But all that code is necessary to make our sites work the way we want.\nThis is the problem with being a frontend dev today. What started out fun for frontend developers, building shit-hot sites with all the bells and whistles, has kinda turned into not fun. We’re now fighting different browsers to support, slow networks to ship code over, and intermittent, mobile connections. Supporting all these permutations is a giant headache.\nHow do we square this circle? By heading back to the server (Swiss basement not required).\nHe goes on to talk about isomorphic JavaScript frameworks and Deno’s offerings in this space.
